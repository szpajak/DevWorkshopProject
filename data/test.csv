We performed a prospective, single blinded study with convenience sampling at a Level I trauma center comparing thoracic ultrasound with chest X-ray and CT scan in the detection of traumatic pneumothorax. Trauma patients that received a thoracic ultrasound, chest X-ray, and chest CT scan were included in the study. The chest X-rays were read by a radiologist who was blinded to the thoracic ultrasound results. Then both were compared with CT scan results. One hundred and twenty-five patients had a thoracic ultrasound performed in the 24-month period. Forty-six patients were excluded from the study due to lack of either a chest X-ray or chest CT scan. Of the remaining 79 patients there were 22 positive pneumothorax found by CT and of those 18 (82%) were found on ultrasound and 7 (32%) were found on chest X-ray. The sensitivity of thoracic ultrasound was found to be 81.8 per cent and the specificity was found to be 100 per cent. The sensitivity of chest X-ray was found to be 31.8 per cent and again the specificity was found to be 100 per cent. The negative predictive value of thoracic ultrasound for pneumothorax was 0.934 and the negative predictive value for chest X-ray for pneumothorax was found to be 0.792. We advocate the use of chest ultrasound for detection of pneumothorax in trauma patients."

CD012233,Transabdominal ultrasound and endoscopic ultrasound for diagnosis of gallbladder polyps,"  To summarise and compare the accuracy of transabdominal ultrasound (TAUS) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), for the detection of gallbladder polyps, for differentiating between true and pseudo gallbladder polyps, or for differentiating between dysplastic polyps/carcinomas and adenomas/pseudo polyps of the gallbladder in adults. Secondary objectives To explore the following sources of heterogeneity: Methodological quality as assessed by QUADAS‐2 (low compared to high/unclear); Prospective compared to retrospective studies; TAUS characteristics: type of the probe (linear compared to curved), frequency of the probe (low: 2 to 5 MHz compared to high: 5 to 8 MHz), and type of scanning (conventional grey, pulsed, colour, Doppler); EUS characteristics; type of endoscope (radial compared to linear), frequency of the probe (less than 15 MHz compared to more than 15 MHz); Experience of performer of TAUS and EUS (five years or more compared to less than five years of experience); Symptomatic compared to asymptomatic people; Presence compared to absence of gallstones.",18333181,1,Ultrasonography in the diagnosis of true gallbladder polyps: the contradiction in the literature.,"Polypoid lesions of the gallbladder (PLGs) are often incidentally identified during ultrasonographic examination of abdominal pain. The present study was designed to determine the reliability of ultrasonography (US) in the diagnosis of PLGs. The records of 853 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) for PLGs in Gazi Medical School from January 2000 to January 2004 were reviewed. Data were collected regarding the patients' gender, age, symptoms, serum lipid levels, the size and the number of polyps on US, surgical indications for PLGs and histopathological diagnosis. In all, 56 of 853 patients had PLGs and underwent LC. Right upper quadrant pain (59%) was the most common presenting symptom that led to gallbladder US. Nearly 75% of the lesions were smaller than 10 mm. At histopathologic examination cholesterolosis was found in 17 of 56 (30%) patients, and 12 of 56 (21%) demonstrated only cholelithiasis; 17 (30%) patients had both cholesterolosis and stones. Only 10 (18%) patients had adenomatous polyp and 8 of these polyps were larger than 1 cm. Overall US-based diagnosis of gallbladder polyp was inaccurate in 82%. The sensitivity and specificity of US for polyps <1 cm was 20% and 95.1%, respectively, whereas the sensitivity and specificity of US for polyps >1 cm was 80% and 99.3%, respectively. The accuracy of US in diagnosing PLGs was poor, especially in polyps <1 cm."

We undertook this prospective study to investigate the incidence of DEI in the presence of goiter (an enlargement of the thyroid gland) and to evaluate factors linked to DEI. We studied 320 consecutive patients scheduled for thyroidectomy. DEI was evaluated by an intubation difficulty scale. The trachea was intubated by an unassisted anesthesiologist, and the intubation difficulty scale was calculated. A univariate analysis was performed to identify potential factors predicting DEI, followed by a multivariate analysis. DEI was reported in 17 patients. The rate of easy tracheal intubation was 36.9%; the rate for patients who had minor difficulty of intubation was 57.8%. Sex (male), body mass index, Mallampati class, thyromental distance, neck mobility, Cormack grade, cancerous goiter, and tracheal deviation or compression were identified in the univariate analysis as potential DEI risk factors. With multivariate analysis, two criteria were recognized as independent for DEI (Cormack Grade III or IV and cancerous goiter). We conclude that the large goiter is not associated with a more frequent DEI. However, the presence of a cancerous goiter is a major factor for predicting DEI."

Secondary objectives To investigate the effects of potential sources of heterogeneity on test accuracy across the included studies. For extrapulmonary TB, covariates of interest were microscopy smear status, HIV status, anti‐TB treatment, past history of TB, reference standard used to verify pleural TB, and prevalence of extrapulmonary TB (culture confirmed) in included studies. For CSF, we considered the presence of a concentration step and specimen volume. For tissue specimens, we considered whether the WHO standard operating procedure was followed. In addition, for TB meningitis, pleural TB, and lymph node TB, we adjusted accuracy estimates by applying a latent class meta‐analysis model to account for the imperfect nature of culture as the reference standard.

The recent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) pandemic has resulted in changing epidemiology and has once again brought extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) into focus. EPTB constitutes about 15 to 20 per cent of all cases of tuberculosis in immunocompetent patients and accounts for more than 50 per cent of the cases in HIV-positive individuals. Lymph nodes are the most common site of involvement followed by pleural effusion and virtually every site of the body can be affected. Since the clinical presentation of EPTB is atypical, tissue samples for the confirmation of diagnostic can sometimes be difficult to procure, and the conventional diagnostic methods have a poor yield, the diagnosis is often delayed. Availability of computerised tomographic scan, magnetic resonance imaging laparoscopy, endoscopy have tremendously helped in anatomical localisation of EPTB. The disease usually responds to standard antituberculosis drug treatment. Biopsy and/or surgery is required to procure tissue samples for diagnosis and for managing complications. Further research is required for evolving the most suitable treatment regimens, optimal duration of treatment and safety when used with highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART)."

Retrospective observational study was performed at the Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Barcelona, Spain. All adult patients with confirmed TL (microbiologically) or probable TL (suspected by clinical presentation, cyto/histopathological features, and clinical improvement after specific treatment) diagnosed from January 2001 to December 2013 were included. One hundred twenty-two patients were included: 78 (63.9%) patients with confirmed diagnosis and 44 (36.1%) patients with probable TL. Seventy (57.4%) patients were nonnative residents. From 83 fine-needle aspiration (FNA) specimens, 54.8% (40/73) showed granulomatous inflammation, 62.5% (40/64) had positive mycobacterial culture, and 73.3% (11/15) tested positive with Xpert MTB/RIF (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA). From 62 biopsy samples, 96.8% (60/62) showed granulomatous inflammation, 64.6% (31/48) had positive mycobacterial culture, and 46.1% (6/13) tested positive with Xpert MTB/RIF. TL has increasingly been diagnosed in our setting, mostly because of cases diagnosed in nonnative residents. FNA is an easy and safe technique for the diagnosis of suspected TL, and the yield regarding mycobacterial culture seems to be similar to the obtained with biopsy. The Xpert MTB/RIF test from FNA specimens may increase the accuracy of the TL diagnosis and provides quicker results."

CD012768,Xpert® MTB/RIF assay for extrapulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance,"  To determine the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert a) for extrapulmonary TB by site of disease in people presumed to have extrapulmonary TB; and b) for rifampicin resistance in people presumed to have extrapulmonary TB. Secondary objectives To investigate the effects of potential sources of heterogeneity on test accuracy across the included studies. For extrapulmonary TB, covariates of interest were microscopy smear status, HIV status, anti‐TB treatment, past history of TB, reference standard used to verify pleural TB, and prevalence of extrapulmonary TB (culture confirmed) in included studies. For CSF, we considered the presence of a concentration step and specimen volume. For tissue specimens, we considered whether the WHO standard operating procedure was followed. In addition, for TB meningitis, pleural TB, and lymph node TB, we adjusted accuracy estimates by applying a latent class meta‐analysis model to account for the imperfect nature of culture as the reference standard. For detection of rifampicin resistance, the covariate of interest in included studies was the prevalence of rifampicin resistance.",21677069,1,Cepheid GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis detection and rifampin resistance identification in patients with substantial clinical indications of tuberculosis and smear-negative microscopy results.,"The GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay was evaluated with microscopically negative and positive pulmonary and extrapulmonary specimens from patients with substantial clinical indications for tuberculosis. For the pulmonary samples, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 90.6%, 94.3%, 93.5%, and 91.7%, and for the extrapulmonary samples, they were 100%, 91.6%, 50%, and 100%, respectively. For microscopically negative specimens, the respective values were 86.3%, 93%, 79%, and 95.6%. The assay correctly detected rifampin resistance in all but one specimen, which harbored a mixed population. The GeneXpert assay was highly effective for tuberculosis diagnosis and identification of rifampin-resistant strains in smear-negative samples."

The recent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) pandemic has resulted in changing epidemiology and has once again brought extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) into focus. EPTB constitutes about 15 to 20 per cent of all cases of tuberculosis in immunocompetent patients and accounts for more than 50 per cent of the cases in HIV-positive individuals. Lymph nodes are the most common site of involvement followed by pleural effusion and virtually every site of the body can be affected. Since the clinical presentation of EPTB is atypical, tissue samples for the confirmation of diagnostic can sometimes be difficult to procure, and the conventional diagnostic methods have a poor yield, the diagnosis is often delayed. Availability of computerised tomographic scan, magnetic resonance imaging laparoscopy, endoscopy have tremendously helped in anatomical localisation of EPTB. The disease usually responds to standard antituberculosis drug treatment. Biopsy and/or surgery is required to procure tissue samples for diagnosis and for managing complications. Further research is required for evolving the most suitable treatment regimens, optimal duration of treatment and safety when used with highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART)."

In this single-centre study, 1620 subjects 11-18 years of age, were randomized to three groups (1:1:1) to receive MenACWY-CRM concomitantly or sequentially with Tdap and HPV. Meningococcal serogroup-specific serum bactericidal assay using human complement (hSBA), and antibodies to Tdap antigens and HPV virus-like particles were determined before and 1 month after study vaccinations. Proportions of subjects with hSBA titres > or =1:8 for all four meningococcal serogroups (A, C, W-135, Y) were non-inferior for both concomitant and sequential administration. Immune responses to Tdap and HPV antigens were comparable when these vaccines were given alone or concomitantly with MenACWY-CRM. All vaccines were well tolerated; concomitant or sequential administration did not increase reactogenicity. MenACWY-CRM was well tolerated and immunogenic in subjects 11-18 years of age, with comparable immune responses to the four serogroups when given alone or concomitantly with Tdap or HPV antigens.

HPV types 6 and 11 cause >90% of genital wart cases; HPV16 and 18 cause 70% of cervical cancers. A prophylactic HPV (types 6, 11, 16, 18) L1 virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine may substantially reduce the incidence of these lesions. This report describes the results of a phase I study of the HPV18 component of such a vaccine. Forty women were randomized to receive either HPV18 L1 VLP vaccine or placebo. Anti-HPV18 responses were measured using a competitive radioimmunoassay (cRIA). Tolerability was evaluated using vaccination report cards (VRC). The study showed that the HPV18 L1 VLP vaccine was generally well-tolerated and highly immunogenic. Peak anti-HPV18 geometric mean titers (GMT) in vaccines were 60-fold greater than those observed in women following natural HPV18 infection. Further studies of a multivalent HPV L1 VLP vaccines are warranted."
CD009069,Prophylactic vaccination against human papillomaviruses to prevent cervical cancer and its precursors,  available in English Español To evaluate the harms and protection of prophylactic human papillomaviruses (HPV) vaccines against cervical precancer and HPV16/18 infection in adolescent girls and women.,25587221,1,Long-term efficacy and safety of human papillomavirus vaccination.,"In this paper, we review the published evidence about the long-term efficacy of the available human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines and their safety profile. Two prophylactic HPV vaccines - bivalent (bHPV) and quadrivalent (qHPV) - are now available, and vaccination programs are being widely implemented, primarily targeting adolescent girls. Efficacy has been widely demonstrated for both vaccines. Since the risk of HPV exposure potentially persists throughout a woman's sexual life, vaccine duration of protection is critical to overall effectiveness. Interpreting the results of long-term efficacy studies for the two HPV vaccines can be puzzling, due to the heterogeneity of studies, different methods used in the assessment of immunogenicity, histopathological and virological end points, and statistical power issues. Moreover, an immunologic correlate of protection has not yet been established, and it is unknown whether higher antibody levels will really result in a longer duration of protection. Disease prevention remains the most important measure of long-term duration of vaccine efficacy. To date, the longest follow-up of an HPV vaccine has been 9.4 years for the bHPV vaccine. Long-term follow-up for qHPV vaccine goes up to 8 years. The vaccine continues to be immunogenic and well tolerated up to 9 years following vaccination. All randomized controlled clinical trials of the bHPV and the qHPV vaccines provide evidence of an excellent safety profile. The most common complaint reported is pain in the injection site, which is self-limiting and spontaneously resolved. The incidence of systemic adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, and discontinuations due to a serious AE reported in clinical studies are similar between the two vaccines and their control groups. In particular, no increased risk of autoimmune disease has been shown among HPV-vaccinated subjects in long-term observation studies. As these are crucial topics in HPV vaccination, it is important to establish systems for continued monitoring of vaccine immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety over time. "

Vi-rEPA contained 25 microg of Vi and induced a greater-than-eightfold rise in immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-Vi in all of the vaccinees tested. In this investigation, we conducted a dosage-immunogenicity study of 5, 12.5, and 25 microg of Vi-rEPA in this age group. Two doses of Vi-rEPA were injected 6 weeks apart. Blood samples were taken before and at 10 weeks (4 weeks after the second injection) and 1 year later. All postimmunization geometric mean (GM) levels were higher than the preimmune levels (P < 0.0001). At 10 weeks, the GM IgG anti-Vi level elicited by 25 microg (102 EU/ml) was higher than those elicited by 12.5 microg (74.7 EU/ml) and 5 microg (43 EU/ml) (P < 0.004): all of the children had > or = 3.52 EU/ml (estimated minimum protective level). One year later, the levels declined about sevenfold (13.3 and 11.3 versus 6.43 EU/ml, P < 0.0001) but remained significantly higher than the preimmune levels (P < 0.0001), and >96% of the children had a greater-than-eightfold rise.

Therefore, identifying genetic and/or biological markers predicting drug-response is increasingly important. Here we present a case-control study and pharmacogenetic association analyses in ADHD investigating three dopaminergic polymorphisms. Previous studies suggested variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) in the dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) and the dopamine transporter (DAT1) genes as genetic risk factors for ADHD and as possible markers of methylphenidate response. Our results did not indicate substantial involvement of these two VNTRs in ADHD, however, both the case-control and the pharmacogenetic analyses showed significant role of the high activity Val-allele of cathecol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val158Met polymorphism in our ADHD population. The Val-allele was more frequent in the ADHD group (n = 173) compared to the healthy population (P = 0.016). The categorical analysis of 90 responders versus 32 non-responders showed an association between the Val-allele or Val/Val genotype and good methylphenidate response (P = 0.009 and P = 0.034, respectively). Analyzing symptom severity as a continuous trait, significant interaction of COMT genotype and methylphenidate was found on the Hyperactivity-Impulsivity scale (P = 0.044). Symptom severity scores of all three genotype groups decreased following methylphenidate administration (P < 0.001), however Val/Val homozygote children had significantly less severe symptoms than those with Met/Met genotype after treatment (P = 0.015). This interaction might reflect the regulatory effect of COMT dominated prefrontal dopamine transmission on subcortical dopamine systems, which are the actual site of methylphenidate action."

(1977), Biochemistry 16 (preceding paper in this issue)], it was demonstrated that Escherichia coli membrane vesicles generate a large electrochemical proton gradient (delta-muH+) under appropriate conditions, and some of the properties of delta-muH+ and its component forces [i.e., the membrane potential (delta psi) and the chemical gradient of protons (deltapH)] were described. In this paper, the relationship between delta-muH+, delta psi, and deltapH and the active transport of specific solutes is examined. Addition of lactose or glucose 6-phosphate to membrane vesicles containing the appropriate transport systems results in partial collapse of deltapH, providing direct evidence for the suggestion that respiratory energy can drive active transport via the pH gradient across the membrane. Titration studies with valinomycin and nigericin lead to the conclusion that, at pH 5.5, there are two general classes of transport systems: those that are driven primarily by delta-muH+ (lactose, proline, serine, glycine, tyrosine, glutamate, leucine, lysine, cysteine, and succinate) and those that are driven primarily by deltapH (glucose 6-phosphate, D-lactate, glucuronate, and gluconate). Importantly, however, it is also demonstrated that at pH 7.5, all of these transport systems are driven by delta psi which comprises the only component of delta-muH+ at this external pH. In addition, the effect of external pH on the steady-state levels of accumulation of different solutes is examined, and it is shown that none of the pH profiles correspond to those observed for delta-muH+, delta psi, or deltapH. Moreover, at external pH values above 6.0-6.5, delta-muH+ is insufficient to account for the concentration gradients established for each substrate unless the stoichiometry between protons and accumulated solutes is greater than unity. The results confirm many facets of the chemiosmotic hypothesis, but they also extend the concept in certain important respects and allow explanations for some earlier observations which seemed to preclude the involvement of chemiosmotic phenomena in active transport."

One of the reasons is the lack of reendothelialization related to inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation and migration since drug is delivered to the luminal surface. Statins can promote angiogenic processes by improving endothelial function, proliferation and migration in cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMECs). This study clarified the effect of simvastatin on Akt/mTOR/p70 S6K and FoxO3a signalling pathways in rat CMECs following pretreated with rapamycin. Rapamycin treatment for 24 h inhibited CMECs' proliferation, migration and NO (nitric oxide) secretion, but with increased cell apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In contrast, simvastatin pretreatment significantly improved proliferation, migration and NO secretion, and inhibited CMECs' apoptosis and ROS production in rapamycin-induced CMECs. Western blot assay showed that, after treatment with simvastatin, the phosphorylation of Akt/mTOR/p70 S6K and FoxO3a were up-regulated in rapamycin-induced CMECs, which was significantly reversed by pretreatment with LY294002. The data suggest that simvastatin inhibits rapamycin-induced CMECs dysfunction and apoptosis, probably through activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR/p70 S6K and mTOR/FoxO3a signalling pathway in a sequential manner and this pathway may be important in some of the pleiotropic effects of statins."

However, there are many differences including the function of the septin proteins, a family of proteins involved in membrane organization in a wide range of organisms. Septins form a characteristic ring on the inner surface of the plasma membrane at the bud neck, whereas the septins are diffusely localized across emerging hyphal tips. In addition, septin rings are maintained at sites of septum formation in hyphae rather than being disassembled immediately after cytokinesis. The possibility that C. albicans septins are regulated by the small ubiquitin-like protein SUMO was examined in this study because the Saccharomyces cerevisiae septins were shown previously to be modified by SUMO (Smt3p). However, SUMO conjugation to septins was not detected during budding or hyphal morphogenesis in C. albicans. These results are supported by the lack of conserved SUMO consensus motifs between septins from the two organisms even after adjusting the predicted Cdc3p and Cdc12p septin sequences to account for mRNA splicing in C. albicans. Interestingly, a homolog of the Smt3p SUMO was identified in the C. albicans genome, and an epitope tagged version of Smt3p was conjugated to a variety of proteins. Immunofluorescence analysis showed prominent Smt3p SUMO localization at bud necks and sites of septum formation in hyphae similar to the septins. However, Smt3p was primarily detected on the mother cell side of the septin ring. A subset of these Smt3p-modified proteins co-immunoprecipitated with the septin Cdc11p. These results indicate that septin-associated proteins and not the septins themselves are the key target of SUMO modification at the bud neck in C. albicans."

Early intervention is crucial for preventing such outcomes. Parents may be reluctant to pursue antidepressant therapy for their children because of concerns about 1) a potential risk of increased suicidal ideation and 2) the effect of these medications on brain development.

This was accomplished by measuring the architectural properties of the five prime wrist movers--extensors carpi radialis brevis (ECRB), extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL), extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU), flexor carpi radials (FCR), flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU)--and predicting their maximum tension (P0) using a specific tension value (22.5 N cm-2. Loading the corresponding tendons to P0 resulted in significantly different strain among tendons (p < 0.01) with the largest strain observed in the FCU (3.68 +/- 0.31%) and the smallest strain observed in the ECRL (1.78 +/- 0.14%). Further, strain magnitude was significantly positively correlated with the tendon length-to-fiber length ratio of the muscle-tendon unit, a measure of the intrinsic compliance of the muscle-tendon unit. Theoretical modeling of the magnitude of muscle sarcomere shortening expected based on the measured biomechanical properties revealed a maximum sarcomere length decrease of about 0.6 micron for the FCU to a minimum of about 0.2 micron for the ECRB at P0. Thus, tendon compliance may, but does not necessarily, result in significant modification of muscle force generation. The significant variation in tendon biomechanical properties was not observed using traditional elongation-to-failure methods on the same specimens. Thus, the use of elongation-to-failure experiments for determination of tendon properties may not be reasonable when the purpose of such studies is to infer physiological function. These data indicate that muscle-tendon units show remarkable specialization and that tendon intrinsic properties accentuate the muscle architectural specialization already present."

Data were drawn from the National Evaluation of Welfare-to-Work Strategies (NEWWS), an experimental evaluation of 11 welfare-to-work programs in seven U.S. cities. In regression models, maternal social support was significantly associated with the likelihood that children experienced an accident or injury between the ages of 8 and 10 such that children of mothers with very limited support were at the highest risk. This association was robust to the inclusion of a wide range of controls, including a prior measure of accident and injury occurrence. A primary finding was that only children whose mothers had the lowest levels of social support, characterized here as socially isolated, suffered significantly higher rates of injury. This suggests that social isolation presents a meaningful threat to child safety and may play an important role in the etiology of child injury among low-income families."

Pitt improved on earlier studies by collecting enough observations to make possible the quantitative analyses of an individual's data. The present article shows that the results of such analyses demonstrate that the integration of phonological information and lexical context is very well accounted for by the fuzzy logical model of perception (FLMP). Although Pitt concluded that the results of his research argued against the FLMP in favor of an interactive feedback system, his conclusion was based on an analysis of transformed results. It is argued that this use of a response transformation led to incorrect conclusions and that ultimately, models must be tested directly against observed behavior."

For this reason, the role of the (P)RR in cardiovascular diseases and diabetes has been particularly studied. However, the discovery of embryonic lethality after (P)RR gene deletion in mouse and zebrafish paved the way for additional roles of (P)RR in cell homoeostasis. Indeed, the (P)RR has been shown to associate with vacuolar H+-ATPase, hence its other name ATP6ap2. Developmental studies in Xenopus and Drosophila have revealed an essential role of this association to promote the canonical and non-canonical Wnt signalling pathways, whereas studies with tissue-specific gene deletion have pointed out a role in autophagy. The present review aims to summarize recent findings on the cellular functions of (P)RR emerging from various mutated and transgenic animal models. "

Two of these mutations (c.869-22_869-23ins18 and c.871A > C, p.T291P) are novel mutations located in intron 8 and exon 9, respectively. The c.869-22_869-23ins18 mutation caused exon 9 skipping whereas the c.871A > C (p.T291P) mutation showed only a modest effect on exon 9 skipping. The previously reported E280G and P264L mutations, located in exon 8, had no effect on mRNA splicing. Infection of cells with mutant T291P, E280G, or P264L cDNAs caused a variable increase in secreted Abeta42. We conclude that none of the previously proposed mechanisms, i.e. exceptionally large increases in secreted Abeta42 levels or loss of PSEN1 exons 8 or 9, provides complete explanation of the CWP/SP phenotype."

Although it is under active investigation, it is still difficult to achieve satisfactory effect for most chemo-drugs on this tumor. It has previously reported that somatostatin could increase the chemosensitivity of gallbladder carcinoma cells (GBC-SD) and reduce the therapeutic dose of Doxorubicin in killing GBC-SD cells. SST could enhance the chemosensitivity of gallbladder carcinoma to Doxorubincin (DOX) by transient arresting cell cycle to S phase. We tried to clarify the mechanism by which SST utilized to enhance the chemosensitivity of GBC-SD cells to DOX.

This antiserum gave specific reactions of identity by agar immunodiffusion with both cytoplasmic and virion NS protein. NS antiserum also preferentially precipitated NS 3-H-labeled protein from infected cytoplasmic extracts, whereas anti-whole VSInd virion serum also precipitated N 3-H-labeled protein from extracts both of infected cytoplasm and virion nucleocapsids. Transcriptase activity of VSInd cytoplasmic or virion-derived nucleocapsids was effectively inhibited by ribonuclease-free immunoglubulin prepared from homologous NSInd antiserum or from anti-whole vesicular stomatitis virus serum. Transcriptase activity of heterologous New Jersey serotype (VSNJ) nucleocapsids and virions was not appreciably affected by anti-NSInd or by anti-whole VSInd virion gamma globulin. Anti-NS gamma glubulin immediately switched off RNA synthesis by actively transcribing VSInd nucleocapsids, a finding which suggests that NS antibody inhibits RNA chain elongation."

Intracellular lipids, a histologic characteristic of the clear cell RCC, can be identified on chemical shift MRI. Intratumoral hemosiderin deposition, as observed histologically with papillary RCC, correlates to the low signal intensity on T2-weighted images. In addition to morphologic imaging features, the different subtypes of RCC have distinct patterns of enhancement on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. Clear cell tumors demonstrate much greater enhancement than papillary and chromophobe RCCs during the corticomedullary and nephrographic phases. The MRI technique arterial spin labeling (ASL) uses magnetic fields to label the water protons in arterial blood and measures blood flow into tissue; quantitative images of blood flow can be generated without exogenous contrast media. Multiple measurements of tumor perfusion may be repeated before and after a physiologic or drug challenge (ie, antiangiogenic therapy). In RCC xenografts and in patients with metastatic RCC, ASL MRI assessments can be used to monitor blood flow changes in response to antiangiogenic therapies. High blood flow on ASL MRI in RCC xenografts correlates with viable tumor at histopathologic analysis, whereas zones of absent or diminished signal correspond to necrosis. ASL MRI has the potential to serve as a biomarker for patients with metastatic RCC by offering a noninvasive measure of tumor blood flow changes accompanying antiangiogenic therapy."

Most ARDS patients survive the acute initial phase of lung injury and progress to either reparation of the lesion or evolution of the syndrome. Despite advances in the management of ARDS, mortality remains high (40%) and autopsies show extended pulmonary fibrosis in 55% of patients, suggesting the importance of deregulated repair in the morbidity and mortality of these patients. Factors influencing progression to fibroproliferative ARDS versus resolution and reconstitution of the normal pulmonary parenchymal architecture are poorly understood. Abnormal repair and remodeling may be profoundly affected by both environmental and genetic factors. In this line, mechanical ventilation may affect the macromolecules that constitute the extracellular matrix (collagen, elastin, fibronectin, laminin, proteoglycan and glycosaminoglycans), suffer changes and impact the biomechanical behavior of lung parenchyma. Furthermore, evidence suggests that acute inflammation and fibrosis may be partially independent and/or interacting processes that are autonomously regulated, and thus amenable to individual and specific therapies. In this review, we explore recent advances in the field of fibroproliferative ARDS/ALI, with special emphasis on 1) the physiological properties of the extracellular matrix, 2) the mechanisms of remodeling, 3) the impact of mechanical ventilation on lung fibrotic response, and (4) therapeutic interventions in the remodeling process."

Although prolactin is known to have major effects on parental care, its role in foraging behavior has rarely been investigated in seabirds to date. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of an experimental decrease in prolactin levels on foraging decisions and its consequences on breeding success in free-living seabirds. To achieve this, we implanted bromocriptine (an inhibitor of prolactin secretion) in male Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae), monitored their foraging behavior using time-depth recorders over several trips, and recorded their reproductive output. On average 8±0.5days after implantation, we showed that bromocriptine administration led to an efficient decrease in prolactin levels. However, no differences were seen in foraging trip durations between bromocriptine-implanted birds and controls. Moreover, the time spent diving and the number of dives performed per trip were similar in both groups. By contrast, all diving parameters (including diving efficiency) were negatively affected by the treatment during the first at-sea trip following the treatment. Finally, the treatment did not affect adult body condition or chick growth and survival. Our study highlights the short-term negative effect of low prolactin levels on diving effort, but indicates that a short-term and/or low-magnitude decrease in prolactin levels alone is not sufficient to modify consistently the body maintenance or the parental investment of Adélie penguins.

Our series consists of nine cases of forgotten stent that had remained indwelling for more than 1 year (mean 36.1 months). We describe and compare their various clinical parameters in terms of encrustation. In addition, we briefly summarize our management schemes. All patients showed few stent related irritative symptoms. Six cases showing minimal or no encrustation shared the common feature of urine hypotonicity. Cystoscopic pullout was possible in these cases. The remaining three cases showed moderate to severe encrustation around the stent which required multiple procedures. Pyuria was observed in all cases and two patients had a history of urolithiasis. Finally, all cases were rendered stent and stone free. The fate of forgotten stents was dependent on the amount of encrustation around the stent. In our study, lithogenic history and presence of pyuria were associated with moderate to severe encrustation. Interestingly, patients showing urine hypotonicity tended to have a minimal encrustation on their stents and the stents were easily removed. Therefore, in patients with an impaired renal concentrating ability and a poor medical condition, the duration of indwelling stents might be safely prolonged if the patient has no risk factor for encrustation. As patients with forgotten stents are less likely to complain of stent related symptoms, thorough education of patients is important to prevent stent related complications."

It was found that increased concentration of one of the tumor markers were not a significant diagnostic sign of the metastases of gastric cancer. CEA is considered as an exception since its more than one and a half elevation (more than 3.75 ng/ml) suggests the presence of metastases with 80% probability. An increased concentration of any two oncomarkers (CEA, CA19-9, CA 72-4) points to the metastases of gastric cancer with 83.3% probability and usually coincides with the presence of distant metastases. A simultaneous elevation of indices of three tumor markers does not occur in gastric cancer. AFP is not informative in cases of gastric cancer and its dissemination."

The magnesium concentration of human milk is about 30 mg/litre, while infant formulas provide about 40-80 mg/litre and cows milk approximately 130 mg/litre. Most of the magnesium in these diets is present in soluble form and in vitro digestibility studies show the remainder to be easily solubilized. The soluble magnesium in infant diets is largely in a low molecular weight form, most likely explaining the high bioavailability of magnesium from infant diets in experimental animals (50-90 per cent). Limited studies in preterm and term infants also indicate a high level of magnesium absorption (55-75 per cent) from human milk and milk-based formulas. Thus, infant diets are likely to supply adequate amounts of magnesium for the growing infant. Magnesium deficiency and toxicity are therefore rare in term infants and usually a consequence of hormonal abnormalities and maternal use of pharmacological doses of magnesium. Low birth weight infants may exhibit hypomagnesaemia and benefit from magnesium supplementation."

Sarcoidosis, which is a chronic inflammatory granulomatous disease, can mimic different rheumatologic diseases including connective tissue diseases. Antinuclear antibodies are the markers used for connective tissue diseases. Aim. To determine antinuclear antibody frequency and any possible correlation with clinical and laboratory data in sarcoidosis patients. Material and Method. Forty-two sarcoidosis patients, 45 rheumatoid arthritis patients, and 45 healthy volunteers who were followed up in rheumatology outpatient clinic were included in this study. Demographic, clinical, serological, and radiological data of all patients were recorded. Antinuclear antibodies were determined with indirect immunofluorescent method and 1/100 titration was accepted as positive. The cases that were ANA positive were evaluated with immunoblot method. Results. Average age of the 42 patients (10 males) with sarcoidosis was 45.2 (20-70 years), and average disease duration was 3.5 years. ANA positivity was detected in 12 (28.5%) patients with sarcoidosis (1/100 in 10 patients, 1/320 in two patients), in 19 of RA patients (42.2%), and in two of healthy volunteers in low titer (P < 0.001). In the subgroup analysis made by immunblot test, one patient had anticentromere antibody, one had anti-Ro antibody, one had anti-Scl-70 antibody, one had anti-dsDNA antibody, and eight patients were negative. The two patients who had anticentromere and anti-Scl-70 antibodies had also Sjögren's syndrome and scleroderma diagnosis, respectively. Discussion. The prevalence of ANA in patients with sarcoidosis was found to be significantly higher than healthy control group and lower than RA patients. This result shows that ANA may have an important role in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis and also could be important in revealing the overlap syndromes of sarcoidosis-connective tissue diseases. Further studies with larger series are necessary in this subject. "

This experiment was to investigate the effects of increasing dietary vitamin E on physical and biochemical characteristics of semen in Indian reared Kadaknath (KN) cockerels. DL-alpha-Tocopherol acetate was used as the source of vitamin E. 2. A total of 135 one-day-old male KN chicks were randomly selected and divided into 9 groups with 15 chicks in each group (3 dietary treatments x 3 replicates). 3. The basal diet contained 15 IU (10 mg) vitamin E/kg and the two experimental diets were supplemented with 150 IU (100 mg) and 300 IU (200 mg) vitamin E/kg (diets T(2) and T(3), respectively). 4. Physical characteristics in terms of semen volume, sperm concentration, sperm motility and percentage live sperm did not differ significantly, whereas proportion of abnormal and dead spermatozoa were significantly lower and fertility higher in the T(2) group. 5. Biochemical characteristics in term of quantities of protein and nitric oxide (NO) did not differ significantly, whereas the quantity of glucose, acid phosphatase (ACP) and vitamin E were significantly higher in the T(2) group. 6. In contrast, the quantities of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) and glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) were significantly lower in T(2) group and higher in the T(1) (control) group. 7. From this study it can be concluded that moderate supplementation of dietary vitamin E may be beneficial for physical and biochemical characteristics of semen in Indian reared KN cock."

AR regulates multiple cellular events, proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, and differentiation. Its expression in prostate cancer cells is regulated by steroid and peptide hormones. AR downregulation by various compounds which are contained in fruits and vegetables is considered a chemopreventive strategy for prostate cancer. There is a bidirectional interaction between the AR and micro-RNA (miRNA) in prostate cancer; androgens may upregulate or downregulate the selected miRNA, whereas the AR itself is a target of miRNA. AR mutations have been discovered in prostate cancer, and their incidence may increase with tumor progression. AR mutations and increased expression of selected coactivators contribute to the acquisition of agonistic properties of anti-androgens. Expression of some of the coactivators is enhanced during androgen ablation. AR activity is regulated by peptides such as cytokines or growth factors which reduce the concentration of androgen required for maximal stimulation of the receptor. In prostate cancer, variant ARs which exhibit constitutive activity were detected. Novel therapies which interfere with intracrine synthesis of androgens or inhibit nuclear translocation of the AR have been introduced in the clinic. "

Paradoxically, LMP-1 itself induces a subdominant CD8+ T-cell response and appears to have evolved to avoid immune recognition. Here we show that, although expression of LMP-1 in human cells dramatically enhanced the trans-presentation of CD8+ T-cell epitopes, cis-presentation of LMP-1-derived epitopes was severely impaired. Testing of a series of LMP-1 mutants revealed that deletion of the first transmembrane domain of LMP-1, which prevented self-aggregation, significantly enhanced cis-presentation of T-cell epitopes from this protein, whereas it lost its ability to up-regulate trans-presentation. Interestingly, we also found that cis-presentation of LMP-1 epitopes was rescued by blocking the proteasome function. Taken together, these results delineate a novel mechanism of immune evasion, which renders a virally encoded oncogene inaccessible to the conventional major histocompatibility complex class I pathway limiting its cis-presentation to effector cells."

Opsonization defect due to MBP deficiency and low levels of the protein can partially be explained by the dominant effect of three different mutations in the structural part of the MBP gene. Large interracial differences in the frequencies of these variants have previously been described, but they cannot explain the large interindividual variation in MBP serum concentration. We describe the existence of additional polymorphisms at positions -550 (H/L variants) and -221 (X/Y variants) in the promoter region of the gene. The promoter haplotypes, HY, LY, and LX, show associations with high, medium, and low levels of MBP serum concentrations, respectively. Moreover, this represents a genetic system with additive effect of haplotypes in which a low producing LX haplotype in the homozygous state down-regulates the basal expression of MBP as effectively as a single structural variant. Populations of pure Eskimos, Caucasoids, and black Africans show marked interethnic differences in the frequencies of promoter haplotypes regulating the expression of the normal peptide, with the HY haplotype frequency varying from 0.83 in Eskimos via 0.33 in Caucasoids to 0.08 in Africans. The LY haplotype frequency varies from 0.04 in Eskimos via 0.39 in Caucasoids to 0.23 in Africans. The LX haplotype frequency varies from 0.03 in Eskimos via 0.24 in Caucasoids to 0.23 in Africans. The effect of the promoter variants can explain almost all of the ethnic differences not explainable by the structural variants alone."

The Lea-Catcheside formula for the G-factor of the BED is integrated numerically using a large number of small trapezoidal fits to each integral. The algorithmically calculated BED is compatible with an analytic calculation for a similarly valued exponentially fitted dose-rate plot and is the only resolution for piecewise defined dose-rate functions.
CD012768,Xpert® MTB/RIF assay for extrapulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance,"  To determine the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert a) for extrapulmonary TB by site of disease in people presumed to have extrapulmonary TB; and b) for rifampicin resistance in people presumed to have extrapulmonary TB. Secondary objectives To investigate the effects of potential sources of heterogeneity on test accuracy across the included studies. For extrapulmonary TB, covariates of interest were microscopy smear status, HIV status, anti‐TB treatment, past history of TB, reference standard used to verify pleural TB, and prevalence of extrapulmonary TB (culture confirmed) in included studies. For CSF, we considered the presence of a concentration step and specimen volume. For tissue specimens, we considered whether the WHO standard operating procedure was followed. In addition, for TB meningitis, pleural TB, and lymph node TB, we adjusted accuracy estimates by applying a latent class meta‐analysis model to account for the imperfect nature of culture as the reference standard.

Male Arbor Acres chickens (1 wk old, n=30) were injected with DEX or saline for 1 wk, and a pair-fed group was included. DEX administration resulted in enhanced lipid deposition in adipose tissues. Plasma insulin increased about 3.3 fold in DEX injected chickens as against the control and hepatic triglyceride was higher as compared with the pair-fed chickens. In DEX injected chickens, the hepatic activities of malic enzyme (ME) and fatty acid synthetase (FAS) were significantly increased, while the mRNA levels of acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), ME, and FAS were significantly up-regulated, compared with the control. Although the mRNA levels of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) genes in adipose tissue were not affected by DEX injection, ME activity and mRNA levels in abdominal fat pad of chickens treated with DEX are higher than those of control chickens. The results indicated that the increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis and in turn, the increased circulating lipid flux contributes to the augmented fat deposition in adipose tissues and liver in DEX-challenged chickens. The results suggest that glucocorticoids together with the induced hyperinsulinemia should be responsible for the up-regulated hepatic lipogenesis."

In this paper, we present a novel adaptive spatial filtering algorithm optimized for robust source time-frequency reconstruction from magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) data. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated with simulated sources and is also applied to real MEG data from a self-paced finger movement task. The algorithm reliably reveals modulations both in the beta band (12-30 Hz) and high gamma band (65-90 Hz) in sensorimotor cortex. The performance is validated by both across-subjects statistical comparisons and by intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG) data from two epilepsy patients. Interestingly, we also reliably observed high frequency activity (30-300 Hz) in the cerebellum, although with variable locations and frequencies across subjects. The proposed algorithm is highly parallelizable and runs efficiently on modern high-performance computing clusters. This method enables the ultimate promise of MEG and EEG for five-dimensional imaging of space, time, and frequency activity in the brain and renders it applicable for widespread studies of human cortical dynamics during cognition."

The impact of confectioner's sugar on the crystallization and rheology of palm oil (PO) and mid-fraction blend (PMF) was investigated in this study. Adding sugar significantly increased storage modulus (G') and firmness (F) of the oils while exhibiting increased sensitivity towards processing conditions. Multiple regression analysis was used to create predictive models that correct for the effects caused by confectioner's sugar, such as altered fat crystal morphology and increased network rigidity, through the binary variable ζ. With limited studies on the use of PO in confectionery applications, these models may be used by industry as tools for production that do not rely on anecdote and overcome any shortcomings associated with the extrapolation from bulk systems."

However, as pointed out by D. Gazzillo [J. Chem. Phys. 134, 124504 (2011)], one of these widely used model potentials, namely, the attractive hard-core Yukawa potential, shows an unphysical behavior when one approaches its sticky limit, since the second virial coefficient is diverging. However, it is exactly this second virial coefficient that is typically used to depict the experimental phase diagram for a large variety of complex fluids and that, in addition, plays an important role in the Noro-Frenkel scaling law [J. Chem. Phys. 113, 2941 (2000)], which is thus not applicable to the Yukawa fluid. To overcome this deficiency of the attractive Yukawa potential, D. Gazzillo has proposed the so-called modified hard-core attractive Yukawa fluid, which allows one to correctly obtain the second and third virial coefficients of adhesive hard-spheres starting from a system with an attractive logarithmic Yukawa-like interaction. In this work we present liquid-vapor coexistence curves for this system and investigate its behavior close to the sticky limit. Results have been obtained with the self-consistent Ornstein-Zernike approximation (SCOZA) for values of the reduced inverse screening length parameter up to 18. The accuracy of SCOZA has been assessed by comparison with Monte Carlo simulations. "

Starting from a fractionated fourth-generation hyperbranched polyester (Boltorn H40), the ring-opening polymerization of ɛ-caprolactone (CL) from the periphery of H40 and subsequent terminal group esterification with 2-bromoisobutyryl bromide afforded star copolymer-based atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) macroinitiator, H40-PCL-Br. Well-defined multiarm star block copolymers, H40-PCL-b-P(OEGMA-co-AzPMA), were then synthesized by the ATRP of oligo(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether methacrylate (OEGMA) and 3-azidopropyl methacrylate (AzPMA). This was followed by the click reaction of H40-PCL-b-P(OEGMA-co-AzPMA) with alkynyl-functionalized cancer cell-targeting moieties, alkynyl-folate, and T(1)-type MRI contrast agents, alkynyl-DOTA-Gd (DOTA is 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetrakisacetic acid), affording H40-PCL-b-P(OEGMA-Gd-FA). In aqueous solution, the amphiphilic multiarm star block copolymer exists as structurally stable unimolecular micelles possessing a hyperbranched polyester core, a hydrophobic PCL inner layer, and a hydrophilic P(OEGMA-Gd-FA) outer corona. H40-PCL-b-P(OEGMA-Gd-FA) unimolecular micelles are capable of encapsulating paclitaxel, a well-known hydrophobic anticancer drug, with a loading content of 6.67 w/w% and exhibiting controlled release of up to 80% loaded drug over a time period of ∼120 h. In vitro MRI experiments demonstrated considerably enhanced T(1) relaxivity (18.14 s(-1) mM(-1)) for unimolecular micelles compared to 3.12 s(-1) mM(-1) for that of the small molecule counterpart, alkynyl-DOTA-Gd. Further experiments of in vivo MR imaging in rats revealed good accumulation of unimolecular micelles within rat liver and kidney, prominent positive contrast enhancement, and relatively long duration of blood circulation. The reported unimolecular micelles-based structurally stable nanocarriers synergistically integrated with cancer targeted drug delivery and controlled release and MR imaging functions augur well for their potential applications as theranostic systems."
CD008874,Airway physical examination tests for detection of difficult airway management in apparently normal adult patients,"  The objective of this review was to characterize and compare the diagnostic accuracy of the Mallampati classification and other commonly used airway examination tests for assessing the physical status of the airway in adult patients with no apparent anatomical airway abnormalities. We performed this individually for each of the four descriptors of the difficult airway: difficult face mask ventilation, difficult laryngoscopy, difficult tracheal intubation, and failed intubation.",25370,0,Specific agglutination of Escherichia coli O128B12 by the mannose-binding proteins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.,"The mannosephilic haemagglutinins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were found to agglutinate cells of Escherichia coli O128B12, to be adsorbed onto them and to attach peroxidase to them. These reactions were specifically inhibited by D-mannose. No agglutination by this Pseudomonas haemagglutinin was obtained when several other enteropathogenic types of Escherichia coli and some other Gram-negative bacteria were examined. Concanavalin A, which also reacted with Escherichia coli O128B12 cells, interacted with some of the other bacteria examined, too. Escherichia coli O128B12 was not agglutinated by the Pseudomonas galactosephilic haemagglutinins and those of the plant Phaseolus vulgaris. Its maximal agglutination by the Pseudomonas mannosephilic haemagglutinins was obtained employing cells grown for 4-6 h in conventional media. The growth temperature, aeration and presence of certain amino acids, but not D-mannose, in the culture medium had some effect on the agglutination in tensity; pH 6-8 was optimal for it and only at pH 3.0-3.2 no agglutination was observed. Treatment of the bacteria by proteolytic enzymes, ethanol or formaldehyde did not alter their agglutinability by either the Pseudomonas lectin or by antibodies produced against them in rabbits. Heating of the bacteria to 100 degrees C prevented their agglutination by the Pseudomonas lectin and lowered their ability to adsorb it, but did not significantly affect their reactions with the rabbit antibodies."

Synthetic nuclei, assembled de novo in extracts of Xenopus eggs, would be predicted to have a large potential for approaching the role of nuclear structure in RNA biogenesis. Synthetic nuclei provide a system in which the genetic content of the nuclei, as well as the structural and enzymatic proteins within the nuclei, can be manipulated. In this study, we have begun to examine transcription in such nuclei by using the most simple of templates, RNA polymerase III (pol III)-transcribed genes. DNA encoding tRNA or 5S genes was added to an assembly extract, and nuclei were formed entirely from the pol III templates. Conditions which allowed nuclear assembly and pol III transcription to take place efficiently and simultaneously in the assembly extract were found. To examine whether pol III transcription could initiate within synthetic nuclei, or instead was inhibited in nuclei and initiated only on rare unincorporated templates, we identified transcriptional inhibitors that were excluded from nuclei. We found that these inhibitors, heparin and dextran sulfate, blocked pol III transcription in the absence of assembly but did not do so following nuclear assembly. At the concentrations used, the inhibitors had no deleterious effect on nuclear structure itself or on nuclear import. We conclude that pol III transcription is active in synthetic nuclei, and this conclusion is further strengthened by the finding that pol III transcripts could be coisolated with synthetic nuclei. The rapid and direct transcriptional analysis possible with pol III templates, coupled with the simple experimental criteria developed in this study for distinguishing between nuclear and non-nuclear transcription, should now allow a molecular analysis of the effect of nuclear structure on transcriptional and posttranscriptional control."

Secondary objectives To investigate the effects of potential sources of heterogeneity on test accuracy across the included studies. For extrapulmonary TB, covariates of interest were microscopy smear status, HIV status, anti‐TB treatment, past history of TB, reference standard used to verify pleural TB, and prevalence of extrapulmonary TB (culture confirmed) in included studies. For CSF, we considered the presence of a concentration step and specimen volume. For tissue specimens, we considered whether the WHO standard operating procedure was followed. In addition, for TB meningitis, pleural TB, and lymph node TB, we adjusted accuracy estimates by applying a latent class meta‐analysis model to account for the imperfect nature of culture as the reference standard. For detection of rifampicin resistance, the covariate of interest in included studies was the prevalence of rifampicin resistance.",12173,0,Post-proline cleaving enzyme. Purification of this endopeptidase by affinity chromatography.,"The endopeptidase, post-proline cleaving enzyme, has been purified 10,500-fold in an overall yield of 18% from lamb kidney. The enzyme possesses a specific activity of 45 mumol/mg/min as tested with the substrate Z-Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly (Km = 6.0 X 10(-5)), has a molecular weight of 115,000, is comprised of two subunits with a molecular weight of 57,000, and exhibits maximal activity at pH 7.5 to 8.0. With the exception of the -Pro-Pro linkage, the -Pro-X-peptide bond (X equals L- and D-amino acid residues) located internally in the peptide sequence can be hydrolyzed (cleavage occurs faster when X = lipophilic side chain as compared to X = acidic side chain). The appropriate -Pro-X- bonds in zinc-free porcine insulin, oxytocin, arginine vasopressin, angiotensin II, bradykinin-potentiating factor were cleaved. Human gastrin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, denatured guinea pig skin collagen, and ascaris cuticle collagen were not degraded. Dipeptides with the structure Z-Pro-LD-X competitively inhibit post-proline cleaving enzyme."

The goal of treatment is restoration of function of the gastrocnemius-soleus complex and the Achilles tendon. These fractures often occur in diabetics and elderly osteoporotic patients and therefore fixation of the displaced fragment is difficult. Displaced fractures, if not recognized and promptly reduced, often result in secondary soft tissue compromise. Often, the fragment is a small shell of osteoporotic bone, which is less than optimal for bony fixation. We present our technique for surgical fixation of calcaneal tuberosity fractures using a suture placed through bone tunnels in the calcaneal body. This technique is used by itself for smaller fragments or supplemented with screw fixation for larger fragments."

Structural analysis of hECE-1 dimer could lead to design specific and effective therapies against Alzheimer's disease. Hence, in the present study homology model of transmembrane helix has been constructed and patched with available crystal structure of hECE-1 monomer. Then, membrane-bound whole model of hECE-1 dimer has been developed by considering biophysical properties of membrane proteins. The explicit molecular dynamics simulation revealed that the hECE-1 dimer exhibits conformational restrains and controls total central cavity by regulating the degree of fluctuations in some residues (238-226) for substrate/product entrance/exit sites. In turn, conformational rearrangements of interdomain linkers as well as helices close to the inner surface are responsible for increasing total central cavity of hECE-1 dimer. Further, the model of hECE-1 dimer was docked with Aβ1-42 followed by MD simulation to investigate possible orientation and interactions of Aβ1-42 in catalytic groove of hECE-1 dimer. The free energy calculations exposed the stability of complex and helped us to identify key residues of hECE-1 involved in interactions with Aβ1-42 peptide. Hence, the present study might be useful to understand structural significance of membrane-bound dimeric hECE-1 to design therapies against Alzheimer's disease. "

With advances in high-throughput molecular profiling technology for various types of molecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins, or metabolites, it is now possible to perform massive profiling analysis that allows accelerating discovery of novel biomolecules. Because no single marker is sufficiently accurate for clinical use, the cancer biomarker is developed in the form of multiple biomarker panels. No single marker is sufficiently accurate for clinical use, and thus cancer biomarkers are developed in the form of multiple biomarker panels. Of various types of molecular biomarkers, microRNA (miRNA) has emerged as a class of promising cancer biomarker recently. MiRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression. The chapter overviews the process of identification of biomarker panels from miRNA profiles focusing on statistical methods. Introduction to molecular cancer biomarkers is touched first. From sample design to miRNA profiling process is reviewed in the method section.Statistical methods for biomarker development are introduced according to three typical purposes of molecular biomarkers: tumor subtype classification, early detection, and prediction of treatment response or prognosis of patients. Example codes for R program are provided as well for selected methods."

CD010239,Lower versus higher oxygen concentrations titrated to target oxygen saturations during resuscitation of preterm infants at birth,"  To determine whether lower or higher initial oxygen concentrations, when titrated according to oxygen saturation targets during the resuscitation of preterm infants at birth, lead to improved short‐ and long‐term mortality and morbidity. Primary comparison Any of the lower concentrations of oxygen (21%, air; > 21% to 29%, very low; ≥ 30% to 39%, low) versus any of the higher concentrations of oxygen (≥ 40% to 59%, high; ≥ 60% to 100%, very high). The primary comparison was analysed by the following subgroups: targeted oxygen saturation (lower or higher limit for oxygen saturation target range for titration < 85%; 85% to 90%; 91% to 95%; > 95%); type of oxygen saturation monitor (fractional or functional oxygen saturation); gestation (< 28 weeks; 28 weeks to 32 weeks; 33 to 36 weeks). Secondary analyses We did not include studies comparing two oxygen concentrations considered to be either in the lower or the higher ranges in the primary analyses. We planned to perform secondary analyses for studies comparing two groups that were both in the lower, or higher, oxygen concentration range (for example, 50% versus 100%).",21683131,0,Health benefits of marine foods and ingredients.,"The health benefits of seafood consumption have primarily been associated with protective effects against cardiovascular diseases (CVD). However, intake of seafood has also been associated with improved foetal and infant development, as well as several other diseases and medical conditions. The health promoting effects have chiefly been attributed to the long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). In addition, the general fatty acid profile is considered favourable. On the other hand, recent and emerging research on seafood proteins and other seafood derived components suggest that these nutritional components contribute to the health effects. In this paper we review the nutritional characteristics and health benefits of marine foods and ingredients, and discuss some current and future trends in marine food production."

The association between mantle irradiation for the treatment of Hodgkin's disease and breast carcinoma has only recently been studied in large populations of cured patients. Several factors including age at radiation treatment, the time between treatment and discovery of the cancer, and radiation dosimetry affect the relative risk of the patient for developing breast cancer. Because there appears to be an increased risk of breast cancer in this patient population, a vigilant screening routine should be initiated, and aggressive operative therapy should be considered."

The disruption of endothelial barrier integrity may contribute to AGE-induced microangiopathy and macrovasculopathy. Previous studies have shown that AGEs induced the rearrangement of actin and subsequent hyperpermeability in endothelial cells (ECs). However, the mechanisms involved in this AGE-evoked EC malfunction are not well understood. This study directly evaluated the involvement of moesin phosphorylation in AGE-induced alterations and the effects of the RhoA and p38 MAPK pathways on this process. Using immortalized human dermal microvascular ECs (HMVECs), we first confirmed that the ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) protein moesin is required in AGE-induced F-actin rearrangement and hyperpermeability responses in ECs by knockdown of moesin protein expression with small interfering RNA. We then detected AGE-induced moesin phosphorylation by Western blot analysis. The mechanisms involved in moesin phosphorylation were analyzed by blocking AGE receptor binding and inhibiting Rho and MAPK pathways. AGE-treated HMVECs exhibited time- and dose-dependent increases in the Thr(558) phosphorylation of moesin. The increased moesin phosphorylation was attenuated by preadministrations of AGE receptor antibody, Rho kinase (ROCK), or p38 inhibitor. Suppression of p38 activation via the expression of dominant negative mutants with Ad.MKK6b or Ad.p38alpha also decreased moesin phosphorylation. The activation of the p38 pathway by transfection of HMVECs with an adenoviral construct of dominant active MKK6b resulted in moesin phosphorylation. These results suggest a critical role of moesin phosphorylation in AGE-induced EC functional and morphological regulations. Activation of the ROCK and p38 pathways is required in moesin phosphorylation."

Secondary objectives To investigate the following potential sources of heterogeneity: type of reference standard, risk of bias, publication status, prospective versus retrospective studies, symptomatic versus asymptomatic participants, recent or current use of proton pump inhibitors or antibiotics, different subtypes of tests, and the interval between the index test and reference standard.",24373710,0,"Cuticular hydrocarbons of Drosophila montana: geographic variation, sexual dimorphism and potential roles as pheromones.","Sexual selection within populations can play an important role in speciation when divergence in mating signals and their corresponding preferences occur along different coevolutionary trajectories in different populations. In insects, one potential target of sexual selection is the blend of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), which often show intra- and interspecific variation, sexual dimorphism and may act as pheromones. In Drosophila montana, a cold-adapted, circumboreal member of the Drosophila virilis species group, flies from different populations have been found to show significant premating isolation as well as variation in male mating signal (song) and female preference. While the role of male courtship song in mate choice has been studied extensively, CHCs in this species have received little attention. In this study, we identified most of the CHCs found on the cuticle of D. montana and characterized population divergence and sexual dimorphism of CHC profiles among flies established from three natural populations - one European and two North American. We also studied their potential role as pheromones by analyzing CHCs of flies used in female-choice mating experiments. We report significant population×sex effects on CHC profiles, as well as significant relationships between some CHC principal components and particular mating behaviours, such as female attractiveness and male mating success, providing evidence that CHCs may play a role in mate choice in this species. The study also provides evidence for variation in the degree to which CHCs play a role in chemical communication among these populations, which may have an influence on the speciation process itself, and could be due to variation in interactions with other closely-related species that occur sympatrically with D. montana in some, but not other, parts of its distribution.

Addition of serum from 2-mercaptoethanol-, 2-mercaptoacetate-, ethionine- or D-galactosamine- treated rats failed to activate heart and adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase from control rats. The activating effect of serum was only slightly reduced in isopropanol-treated rats, whereas it was found unaffected in ethanol-treated ones. Electrophoresis of the lipoproteins and of the very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) fraction of sera from 2-mercaptoethanol-, 2-mercaptoacetate-, isopropanol-, ethionine- and D-galactosamine-treated rats suggest that the lack of lipoprotein lipase activation ability of these sera is most probably related to the impairing effects of these drugs upon VLDL metabolism, i.e. reduction of VLDL secretion in the case of 2-mercaptoethanol, 2-mercaptoacetate and isopropanol, production of abnormal VLDL in the case of D-galactosamine and both decreased VLDL secretion and production of abnormal VLDL in the case of ethionine."

But to date, there is no guideline for the systematic, transparent and complete reporting of secondary data. We investigated whether the STROBE statement, i.e., the recommendations for reporting observational studies, satisfies the specific characteristics of secondary data analyses and whether any specifications/modifications and extensions are necessary. For the majority of the 22 STROBE criteria, specifications and extensions are needed to meet the requirements of systematic, transparent and complete reporting of secondary data analysis. Seven aspects of secondary data analysis not covered by STROBE (legal aspects, data flow, protocol, unit of analysis, internal validations/definitions, advantages of secondary data utilisation, role of data owners) should be considered as a specific complement to STROBE. The so called STROSA (STandardized Reporting Of Secondary data Analyses) checklist therefore includes 29 items that relate to the title/abstract, introduction, methods, results and discussion sections of articles. The STROSA checklist is intended to support authors and readers in the critical appraisal of secondary data analyses. This proposal will now be subject to continued scientific discussions. "

Secondary objectives To investigate the effects of potential sources of heterogeneity on test accuracy across the included studies. For extrapulmonary TB, covariates of interest were microscopy smear status, HIV status, anti‐TB treatment, past history of TB, reference standard used to verify pleural TB, and prevalence of extrapulmonary TB (culture confirmed) in included studies. For CSF, we considered the presence of a concentration step and specimen volume. For tissue specimens, we considered whether the WHO standard operating procedure was followed. In addition, for TB meningitis, pleural TB, and lymph node TB, we adjusted accuracy estimates by applying a latent class meta‐analysis model to account for the imperfect nature of culture as the reference standard. For detection of rifampicin resistance, the covariate of interest in included studies was the prevalence of rifampicin resistance.",19944429,0,The association between cognitive impairment and quality of life in patients with early multiple sclerosis.,"Cognitive deficits are common in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and may be observed early in the course of the disease. Current knowledge about the association between cognitive impairment and health-related quality of life (HQOL) in patients with early MS is limited. We used a well-established battery of cognitive tests and standardized HQOL measures to examine the associations between overall and domain-specific cognitive performance and quality of life in patients with early MS. Ninety-two patients with CIS or MS diagnosed in the previous three years participating in the CLIMB Natural History Study underwent a neurologic examination, neuropsychological evaluation and quality of life assessment. Associations between cognitive scores and HQOL measures were examined. There were no differences between cognitively impaired versus unimpaired subjects on any of the HQOL measures. After controlling for depression, scores on tests of information processing speed were significantly associated with several measures of HQOL including physical well-being, fatigue, and social support. In all cases, correlations between HQOL and cognitive measures were mild. These findings were observed in patients with limited cognitive impairment and minimal physical disability. Our results suggest that cognitive remediation programs aimed at improving cognitive skills may also improve quality of life for patients with early MS."

In the absence of starch-branching enzyme IIb, the further absence of starch-branching enzyme Ia leads to increased branching.","Previous studies indicated that the deficiency of starch-branching enzyme (SBE) Ia in the single mutant sbe1a::Mu (sbe1a) has no impact on endosperm starch structure, whereas the deficiency of SBEIIb in the ae mutant is well known to reduce the branching of starch. We hypothesized that in maize (Zea mays) endosperm, the function of SBEIIb is predominant to that of SBEIa, and SBEIa would have an observable effect only on amylopectin structure in the absence of SBEIIb. To test this hypothesis, the mutant sbe1a was introgressed into lines containing either wx (lacking the granule-bound starch synthase GBSSI) or ae wx (lacking both SBEIIb and GBSSI) in the W64A background. Both western blotting and zymogram analysis confirmed the SBEIa deficiency in sbe1a wx and sbe1a ae wx, and the SBEIIb deficiency in ae wx and sbe1a ae wx. Using zymogram analysis, no pleiotropic effects of sbe1a genes on SBEIIa, starch synthase, or starch-debranching enzyme isoforms were observed. High-performance size exclusion chromatography analysis shows that the chain-length profiles of amylopectin as well as beta-limit dextrin were indistinguishable between wx and sbe1a wx, whereas significant differences for both were observed between ae wx and sbe1a ae wx, suggesting an effect of SBEIa on amylopectin biosynthesis that is observable only in the absence of SBEIIb. The amylopectin branch density and the average number of branches per cluster were both higher in endosperm starch from sbe1a ae wx than from ae wx. These results indicate possible functional interactions between SBE isoforms that may involve enzymatic inhibition. Both the cluster repeat distance and the distance between branch points on the short intracluster chains were similar for all genotypes however, suggesting a similar pattern of individual SBE isoforms in cluster initiation and the determination of branch point location."

CD010239,Lower versus higher oxygen concentrations titrated to target oxygen saturations during resuscitation of preterm infants at birth,"  To determine whether lower or higher initial oxygen concentrations, when titrated according to oxygen saturation targets during the resuscitation of preterm infants at birth, lead to improved short‐ and long‐term mortality and morbidity. Primary comparison Any of the lower concentrations of oxygen (21%, air; > 21% to 29%, very low; ≥ 30% to 39%, low) versus any of the higher concentrations of oxygen (≥ 40% to 59%, high; ≥ 60% to 100%, very high). The primary comparison was analysed by the following subgroups: targeted oxygen saturation (lower or higher limit for oxygen saturation target range for titration < 85%; 85% to 90%; 91% to 95%; > 95%); type of oxygen saturation monitor (fractional or functional oxygen saturation); gestation (< 28 weeks; 28 weeks to 32 weeks; 33 to 36 weeks). Secondary analyses We did not include studies comparing two oxygen concentrations considered to be either in the lower or the higher ranges in the primary analyses. We planned to perform secondary analyses for studies comparing two groups that were both in the lower, or higher, oxygen concentration range (for example, 50% versus 100%).",19397308,0,"Formation and efflux of ATP-binding cassette transporter substrate 2,4-dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione from cultured human term placental villous tissue fragments.","Upon exposure to 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), the human placental tissue forms its glutathione conjugate 2,4-dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione (DNP-SG). The purpose of this study was to investigate the involvement of human placental ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in the efflux of DNP-SG. Placental tissue samples were obtained from pregnant patients undergoing C-section deliveries following normal pregnancies; villous tissue was cultured in suspension, and DNP-SG formation and efflux upon exposure to 100 microM CDNB were measured by HPLC. DNP-SG efflux decreased by 69.1 (+/-11.3)%, 51.1 (+/-5.4)%, 56.7 (+/-8.3)% and 53.6 (+/-10.8)% (p < 0.05) in the presence of 5 mM sodium orthovanadate (ATPase inhibitor), 100 microM MK571 (MRP-inhibitor), 1 mM dipyridamole (BCRP/P-gp/MRP1-inhibitor) and 100 microM verapamil (P-gp/MRP1 inhibitor) respectively, without any change in DNP-SG formation, total tissue glutathione, GSH/GSSG ratio, tissue integrity or tissue viability. These data clearly established the role of ABC transporters in the human placental efflux of DNP-SG. To investigate the contribution of various ABC transporters toward DNP-SG transport, ATP-dependent transport of 3H-DNP-SG was determined in Sf9 membrane vesicles overexpressing P-gp, BCRP and the MRP proteins. MRP1-mediated DNP-SG transport was inhibited in the presence of sodium orthovanadate, MK571, dipyridamole and verapamil in the presence of glutathione. Furthermore, MRP1-mediated transport [K(t) = 11.3 +/- 1.3 microM and v(max) = 86.7 +/- 1.9 pmol/mg/min] was a high-affinity process compared to MRP2-mediated transport [K(t) = 168 +/- 7 microM and v(max) = 1367 +/- 18 pmol/mg/min]. The inhibition pattern and the kinetics of DNP-SG efflux in the placental villous tissue were consistent with MRP1-mediated DNP-SG efflux, suggesting a functional role and an apical localization for an MRP1-like transporter in the human placental syncytiotrophoblast."

Hypertension, an important cause of chronic renal failure, leads to afferent arteriolopathy, segmental glomerulosclerosis and tubular atrophy in the juxtamedullary cortex. We investigated the pathological changes of hypertensive renal disease in aged spontaneously hypertensive rats using a large number of serial sections, where we traced and analyzed afferent arteriole, glomerulus and proximal tubule of single nephrons. Our major finding was that both afferent arteriolopathy and glomerular capillary collapse were linked to tubular atrophy. Only nephrons with glomerular collapse (n = 13) showed tubules with reduced diameter indicating atrophy [21.66 ± 2.56 μm vs. tubules in normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) 38.56 ± 0.56 μm, p < 0.05], as well as afferent arteriolar wall hypertrophy (diameter 32.74 ± 4.72 μm vs. afferent arterioles in WKY 19.24 ± 0.98 μm, p < 0.05). Nephrons with segmental sclerosis (n = 10) did not show tubular atrophy and tubular diameters were unchanged (35.60 ± 1.43 μm). Afferent arteriolar diameter negatively correlated with glomerular capillary volume fraction (r = -0.36) and proximal tubular diameter (r = -0.46) implying reduced glomerular and tubular flow. In line with this, chronically damaged tubules showed reduced staining for the ciliary protein inversin indicating changed ciliary signalling due to reduced urinary flow. This is the first morphological study on hypertensive renal disease making correlations between vascular, glomerular and tubular components of individual nephron units. Our data suggest that afferent arteriolopathy leads to glomerular collapse and reduced urinary flow with subsequent tubular atrophy."

STATs are activated directly by members of the Jak (Janus kinase) family and, when activated, migrate to the nucleus to modify gene expression to produce a variety of cellular responses. Individual cytokines activate specific combinations of the Jak/STAT isoforms. A previous study localized the known Jak isoforms and STAT-1 in 5-day-old rat molars during the early stages of enamel and dentine formation. The present study was undertaken to localize immunohistochemically STAT isoforms STAT-2. -3, -4 and -5 in association with events involved in early dentine and enamel formation in 5-day-old rat molars. Each of the isoform localization patterns was different from the others. Combining the results of the previous study with the present findings, it appears that all of the known Jaks and STATs-1, -2, -3, -4 and -5 are located in the cells directly involved in early enamel or dentine formation. Using colocalization patterns of the individual Jaks and STATs, individual receptor locations may be predicted. In the proximal ends of differentiated ameloblasts, several cytokine receptors [interleukin (IL) -5, -6, -7, -9, -10, -12, growth hormone granulocyte colony-stimulating factor interferon-alpha/beta. -gamma] are predicted. In other areas of the early odontogenic cells, the proximal ends of differentiating ameloblasts are predicted to have IL-7 receptors, inner enamel epithelium IL-6 and IL-10 receptors, and stratum intermedium cells IL-6 receptors. In the early developing dentine, differentiating odontoblasts are predicted to have IL-6 and IL-10 receptors, and differentiated odontoblasts no cytokine receptors identified by known Jak/STAT combinations. Mapping of the Jak and STAT isoforms in the cells involved in early enamel and dentine formation indicates that a sizeable list of ligands and their respective cytokine receptor/pathway complexes are involved in the regulation of these processes."

In the present study, P300 event-related potentials were used to investigate possible effects of behavioral treatment on the pattern of signal amplitude and latency between waves. In order to compare variations in P300 measurements, a control group paired by age and gender to the group of stutterers, was included in the study. Findings suggest that the group of stutterers presented a significant decrease in stuttering severity after the fluency treatment program. Regarding P300 measurements, stutterers and their controls presented results within normal limits in all testing situations and no significant statistical variations between pre and post treatment testing. When comparing individual results between the testing situations, stutterers presented a higher average decrease in wave latency for the right ear following treatment. The results are discussed in light of previous P300 event-related potentials and functional imaging studies with stuttering adults."

Although much is known about the packing geometry observed between alpha-helices and between beta-sheets, there has been little progress on characterizing helix-sheet interactions. We present an analysis of the conformation of alphabeta(2) motifs in proteins, corresponding to all occurrences of helices in contact with two strands that are hydrogen bonded. The geometry of the alphabeta(2) motif is characterized by the azimuthal angle theta between the helix axis and an average vector representing the two strands, the elevation angle psi between the helix axis and the plane containing the two strands, and the distance D between the helix and the strands. We observe that the helix tends to align to the two strands, with a preference for an antiparallel orientation if the two strands are parallel; this preference is diminished for other topologies of the beta-sheet. Side-chain packing at the interface between the helix and the strands is mostly hydrophobic, with a preference for aliphatic amino acids in the strand and aromatic amino acids in the helix. From the knowledge of the geometry and amino acid propensities of alphabeta(2) motifs in proteins, we have derived different statistical potentials that are shown to be efficient in picking native-like conformations among a set of non-native conformations in well-known decoy datasets. The information on the geometry of alphabeta(2) motifs as well as the related statistical potentials have applications in the field of protein structure prediction."

Although PMMA does offer a mechanism to quickly and effectively administer a localized dose of antibiotic to the site of infection, its efficacy is limited by its nonresorbability and nonbioactivity. Resorbable bioactive silica-calcium phosphate nanocomposite (SCPC75) was investigated as a novel controlled release carrier of vancomycin for the treatment of osteomyelitis. SCPC75 particles adsorbed significantly higher amount of vancomycin compared with PMMA. Moreover, SCPC75 provided a sustained release kinetics of therapeutic dose of vancomycin up to 35 days. The novel resorbable ceramic was able to release 95.5% of the adsorbed drug in an average dose of 12 microg/mL/day over 480 h (35 days). In conjunction with the sustained drug release, a controlled dissolution rate that led to 40% mass loss of SCPC75 was observed. On the other hand, PMMA provided a sustained release of a therapeutic dose of vancomycin for 14 days after which minimal concentration of the drug was detected. Moreover, PMMA retained 32% of the drug adsorbed onto its surface. The SCPC-vancomycin implant can serve a dual function: provide a sustained therapeutic dose of antibiotic to eradicate infection and stimulate bone cell differentiation and new bone formation.

CD001261,Vaccines for preventing typhoid fever,  available in English Español To assess the effects of vaccines for preventing typhoid fever.,21675487,0,Collaborative project to co-ordinate care for patients with dementia.,"Health leaders from across Suffolk joined together in a collaborative action-learning project to identify ways of offering more productive and personalised care for patients with dementia and their carers. The project revealed a range of factors necessary for success, notably professional collaboration and effective facilitation. The outcome was a range of evidenced-based recommendations to improve care and efficiency, as well as ensuring that the quality, innovation, productivity and prevention (QIPP) agenda was met. The lessons can be applied not just in dementia care, but to other long-term and complex care situations."

At least eleven members of the FA gene family have been identified using complementation experiments. Ubiquitin-proteasome has been shown to be a key regulator of FA proteins and their involvement in the repair of DNA damage. Here, we identified a novel functional link between the FA/BRCA pathway and E2F-mediated cell cycle regulome. In silico mining of a transcriptome database and promoter analyses revealed that a significant number of FA gene members were regulated by E2F transcription factors, known to be pivotal regulators of cell cycle progression - as previously described for BRCA1. Our findings suggest that E2Fs partly determine cell fate through the FA/BRCA pathway."
