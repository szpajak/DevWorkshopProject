CD009925,Second trimester serum tests for Down's Syndrome screening,"The aim of this review was to estimate and compare the accuracy of second trimester serum markers for the detection of Down’s syndrome in the antenatal period, both as individual markers and as combinations of markers. Accuracy is described by the proportion of fetuses with Down’s syndrome detected by screening before birth (sensitivity or detection rate) and the proportion of women with a low risk (normal) screening test result who subsequently had a baby unaffected by Down's syndrome (specificity). We grouped our analyses to focus on investigating the value of adding increasing numbers of markers (comparing single, dual, triple and quadruple tests), and of including Inhibin A, the most recent routine addition to serum marker combinations. Investigation of sources of heterogeneity We investigated whether a uniform screening test is suitable for all women, or whether different screening methods are more applicable to different groups, defined by advanced maternal age, ethnic groups and aspects of the pregnancy and medical history such as multiple pregnancy, diabetes and family history of Down's syndrome. We also considered whether there existed evidence of overestimation of test accuracy in studies evaluating risk equations in the derivation sample rather than in a separate validation sample.",15493716,1,Evaluation of second trimester maternal serum screening for Down's Syndrome using the Spiegelhalter-Knill-Jones (S-KJ) approach.,"Risk estimation for Down's syndrome in antenatal serum screening with maternal age and multiple serum biomarkers is usually complicated and computationally intensive.

Prospective studies in a total of 200,868 pregnancies, including 871 fetuses with trisomy 21, have demonstrated that increased nuchal translucency can identify 76.8% of fetuses with trisomy 21, which represents a false-positive rate of 4.2%. When fetal nuchal translucency was combined with maternal serum free-beta-human chorionic gonadotropin and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A in prospective studies in a total of 44,613 pregnancies, including 215 fetuses with trisomy 21, the detection rate was 87.0% for a false-positive rate of 5.0%. Studies from specialist centers with 15,822 pregnancies, which included 397 fetuses with trisomy 21, have demonstrated that the absence of the nasal bone can identify 69.0% of trisomy 21 fetuses, which represents a false-positive rate of 1.4%. It has been estimated that first-trimester screening by a combination of sonography and maternal serum testing can identify 97% of trisomy 21 fetuses, which represents a false-positive rate of 5%, or that the detection rate can be 91%, which represents a false-positive rate of 0.5%. In addition to increased nuchal translucency, important sonographic markers for chromosomal abnormalities, include fetal growth restriction, tachycardia, abnormal flow in the ductus venosus, megacystis, exomphalos and single umbilical artery. Most pregnant women prefer screening in the first, rather than in the second, trimester. As with all aspects of good clinical practice, those care givers who perform first-trimester screening should be trained appropriately, and their results should be subjected to external quality assurance."

Of the 981 screened, there were 8 chromosomally abnormal pregnancies. Six of these were considered to be at increased risk on serum screening, all of which were detected. Of the remaining 2, one was detected by ultrasound and the other resulted in a liveborn baby with trisomy 21. The positive and negative predictive values for serum screening for all chromosomal abnormalities was 7.8% and 99.9% respectively. The sensitivity and specificity was 87.5% and 91.5% respectively. Serum screening is useful in the detection of many chromosomal abnormalities, not just Down syndrome. The combination of maternal serum screening and ultrasound has a high negative predictive value and is valuable in providing reassurance of no underlying chromosomal abnormality. With a positive predictive value of 7.8% a chromosomal abnormality will be found once in every 13 amniocenteses performed."

On this basis, many screening programmes adjust the marker levels to take account of this difference. Recent studies suggested that the marker levels were not different, and so adjustment may no longer be needed, possibly because of better diabetic control. Data from a prenatal screening programme for Down syndrome were examined to see whether the median values of second-trimester screening markers were still reduced in pregnant women with IDDM. A total of 366 women with IDDM singleton pregnancies without Down syndrome were identified from the screening programme at Barts from 1989 to 2002. After allowing for maternal weight, the median multiples of the median (MoM) for IDDM-unaffected singleton pregnancies were as follows: 0.88 (95% confidence interval 0.84-0.93) for alphafetoprotein (AFP), 0.95 (0.91-0.99) for unconjugated oestriol (uE3), 0.90 (0.80-1.01) for total human chorionic gonadotrophin (total hCG), 0.98 (0.88-1.08) for free beta-hCG, and 0.99 (0.89-1.10) for inhibin-A. The median levels for AFP and uE3 were statistically significantly lower in pregnant women with IDDM. The other markers were not significantly different in women with and without IDDM. There remains a case for adjusting AFP and uE3 levels in women with IDDM in prenatal screening programmes for Down syndrome."

This study was designed to determine the prevalence and clinical impact of mycoplasma and chlamydia pneumonia in children hospitalized with severe pneumonia. Children 1 month-15 years old with a diagnosis of severe pneumonia (WHO criteria) were recruited between March 2005 and March 2006. Serologic studies were performed for anti-M. pneumoniae and anti-C. pneumoniae IgG/M on admission and 2-4 weeks afterward using ELISA. Of 52 patients, 13 (25%) were positive for Mycoplasma, 8 (15%) were positive for Chlamydia, 4 (7.6%) were positive for a mixed infection and 27 (52%) were negative. The subjects' mean age was 23.8+/-4.1 months. The mean of initial oxygen saturation on admission was 87.5+/-1.2%. Fever and prolonged cough were the leading symptoms. The mean of hospitalization was 18.8+/-2.6 days, chlamydia pneumonia had the longest duration, 30+/-10.2 days and 13/52 (25%) study subjects developed respiratory failure. Only 10% were treated with adequate antibiotic prior to serologic results. There was one mortality (1/52, 2%). Our study suggests that mycoplasma and chlamydia infections are commonly found among children hospitalized with severe pneumonia. Coverage with an appropriate antibiotic should be considered to hasten recovery."

Patients were randomized 1:1 to a 10-day course of either clarithromycin suspension 15 mg/kg/day divided twice a day or erythromycin suspension 40 mg/kg/day divided twice a day or three times a day. Evidence of infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae was detected in 28% (74) of patients: 13% (34) by nasopharyngeal culture and 18% (48) by serology with the microimmunofluorescence assay. Evidence of infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected in 27% (69) of patients: 20% (53) by nasopharyngeal culture or polymerase chain reaction and 17% (44) by serology with the use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serologic confirmation of infection was observed in 23% (8) and 53% (28) of patients with bacteriologically detected C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae, respectively. Treatment with clarithromycin vs. erythromycin, respectively, yielded the following outcomes: clinical success 98% (121 of 124) vs. 95% (105 of 110); radiologic success 98% (109 of 111) vs. 94% (92 of 110); and eradication by pathogen, C. pneumoniae 79% (15 of 19) vs. 86% (12 of 14) and M. pneumoniae 100% (9 of 9) vs. 100% (4 of 4). Adverse events were primarily gastrointestinal occurring in almost one-fourth of patients in both groups, and were mild to moderate in severity. Clarithromycin and erythromycin were similarly effective and safe for the treatment of radiographically proved, community-acquired pneumonia in children older than 2 years old.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD010864,D-dimer test for excluding the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism," To investigate the ability of the D‐dimer test to rule out a diagnosis of acute PE in patients treated in hospital outpatient and accident and emergency (A&E) settings who have had a pre‐test probability (PTP) of PE determined according to a clinical prediction rule (CPR), by estimating the accuracy of the test according to estimates of sensitivity and specificity. The review focuses on those patients who are not already established on anticoagulation at the time of study recruitment.",18343077,1,Outcomes of high pretest probability patients undergoing d-dimer testing for pulmonary embolism: a pilot study.,"ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) D-dimer testing is commonly used in the evaluation of possible pulmonary embolism (PE) in the emergency department, but is not recommended in high pretest probability patients. Whether a negative ELISA D-dimer can safely rule out PE in these patients is not known, as there have been no large studies comparing ELISA D-dimer results and outcomes in high pretest probability patients. This was a prospective observational pilot study of emergency department patients evaluated for PE. Patients evaluated for PE had pretest probability assessed by the Wells PE Score. High pretest probability was defined as: dichotomized Wells Score>4 points and patients with trichotomized Wells Score>6 points. Patients had an ELISA D-dimer ordered by the treating physician. Pulmonary embolism was defined as: positive computed tomography scan, high probability ventilation/perfusion scan, positive pulmonary angiogram, or PE on 3-month follow-up. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and likelihood ratios for the ELISA D-dimer. We prospectively enrolled 541 patients who underwent D-dimer testing for PE, of whom 130 patients had Wells Score>4 and 33 patients had Wells Score>6 (not mutually exclusive). Of subjects with Wells Score>4, 23 (18%) were diagnosed with PE and 40 (31%) had a negative D-dimer. No patient with Wells Score>4 (sensitivity 100%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 82%-100%; specificity 37%, 95% CI 28%-47%) or Wells Score>6 (sensitivity 100%, 95% CI 63%-100%; specificity 56%, 95% CI 35%-76%) who had a negative D-dimer was diagnosed with PE. The likelihood ratio for a negative D-dimer was 0 for both the Wells>4, and Wells>6 groups, however, the upper limits of the confidence interval around the post-test probability for PE were 16% and 33%, respectively, for these high probability groups. In this pilot study, the rapid ELISA D-dimer had high sensitivity and negative predictive value even when applied to patients with high pretest probability for PE. However, with the post-test probability of PE still as high as 16-33% in the negative D-dimer groups, this precludes applying the results to patient care at present. Further testing is warranted to determine whether these findings can be safely incorporated into practice."

For this subset of lesions, there are few data relating human papillomavirus type to cytology and cell cycle activity. Here, we collected 24 cases of papillary squamous intraepithelial lesions with either low-risk (15 cases) or high-risk (9 cases) human papillomavirus infection. We described their morphology and performed immunohistochemical staining with cell cycle-related markers Ki-67, p53, pRb, and P16INK4a. The Ki-67 labeling index was significantly lower in the low-risk group than in the high-risk group (P < .001). A cut point of less than 50% labeling index detected all but one low-risk group case. Degradation of p53 and pRb was less evident in the low-risk group than in the high-risk group (p53, P < .001; pRb, P = .006). P16INK4a produced an unexpectedly high positive rate of staining in the low-risk group (60%). However, a specific top-heavy distribution pattern was noted, with evident nuclear but faint cytoplasmic staining, whereas the high-risk group showed strong full-thickness nuclear and cytoplasmic staining. The detection of these lesions by smear examination was not reliable, given the wide expression pattern. Papillary structure was evident in none. We conclude that cell cycle-related markers are helpful in distinguishing low- and high-risk lesions. The strong p16INK4a staining in the low-risk group may imply that more cell cycle-controlling pressure is elicited in papillary lesions than in flat lesions. The distribution pattern of p16INK4a staining is important when making a diagnosis; cytology is not effective. Human papillomavirus type, histology, and cell cycle markers could clearly separate these lesions into either a low-risk or a high-risk group, properly designated low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions in current management algorithms. Thus, the previously used terms papillary immature metaplasia and immature condyloma, although descriptive for low-risk group lesions, are confusing and should be discarded."

Human papillomavirus is the single most important etiological agent in cervical cancer. HPV contributes to neoplastic progression through the action of two viral oncoproteins E6 and E7, which interfere with critical cell cycle pathways, p53, and retinoblastoma. However, evidence suggests that HPV infection alone is insufficient to induce malignant changes and other host genetic variations are important in the development of cervical cancer. Advances in molecular biology and high throughput gene expression profiling technologies have heralded a new era in biomarker discovery and identification of molecular targets related to carcinogenesis. These advancements have improved our understanding of carcinogenesis and will facilitate screening, early detection, management, and personalised targeted therapy. In this chapter, we have described the use of high density microarrays to assess gene expression profiles in cervical cancer. Using this approach we have identified a number of novel genes which are differentially expressed in cervical cancer, including several genes involved in cell cycle regulation. These include p16ink4a, MCM 3 and 5, CDC6, Geminin, Cyclins A-D, TOPO2A, CDCA1, and BIRC5. We have validated expression of mRNA using real-time PCR and protein by immunohistochemistry."

Group A consisted of 30 blood culture-positive cases of typhoid fever and group B consisted of 30 suspected cases of typhoid fever who had sterile blood cultures but positive Widal tests. Thirty cases of pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO) were placed in group C, while group D consisted of 15 cases of septicaemia caused by organisms other than Salmonella serotype Typhi. Group E comprised 50 normal healthy individuals with no history of typhoid fever or TAB vaccination in the previous 5 years. The Vi-LA test performed best with 96.7% of group A sera and 90% of group B sera giving positive results. No false positive results and only 2.58% false negative results were obtained with this test. Considering patients with positive blood culture results or positive Widal tests as true positives, the sensitivities of the Vi-LA, BP-LA, Vi-coagg and BP-coagg tests were 93.3, 91.7, 83.3 and 86.7%, respectively. The specificities of these tests were 100, 98.5, 98.5 and 98.5%, respectively. It is suggested that the Vi-LA test can be used for the rapid and early diagnosis of typhoid fever."

In addition to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae described previously, five other pathogens, Neisseria meningitidis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes, were targeted, based on a large-scale surveillance in Japan. Results in CSF from neonates and children (n=150), and from adults (n=18) analyzed by real-time PCR with molecular beacon probes were compared with those of conventional culturing. The total time from DNA extraction from CSF to PCR analysis was 1.5 h. The limit of detection for these pathogens ranged from 5 copies to 28 copies per tube. Nonspecific positive reactions were not recognized for 37 microorganisms in clinical isolates as a negative control. The pathogens were detected in 72.0% of the samples by real-time PCR, but in only 48.2% by culture, although the microorganisms were completely concordant. With the real-time PCR, the detection rate of H. influenzae from CSF was high, at 45.2%, followed by S. pneumoniae (21.4%), S. agalactiae (2.4%), E. coli (1.8%), L. monocytogenes (0.6%), and M. pneumoniae (0.6%). The detection rate with PCR was significantly better than that with cultures in patients with antibiotic administration (chi2=18.3182; P=0.0000). In conclusion, detection with real-time PCR is useful for rapidly identifying the causative pathogens of meningitis and for examining the clinical course of chemotherapy."

The maximum standardized uptake value obtained with integrated fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography has been proposed to be a predictor of malignancy in mediastinal lymph nodes. A recent study has also suggested that accuracy of integrated fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography might be improved by increasing the maximum standardized uptake value used for calling a lymph node positive from 2.5 to 5.3. We tested the hypotheses that the maximum standardized uptake value is a predictor of individual lymph node metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer and that pathologic staging with mediastinoscopy might not be necessary in patients with a maximum standardized uptake value of less than 5.3 in their mediastinal lymph nodes.

From April 2005 to November 2008, 58 patients underwent a lobectomy with systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node dissection for clinical stage IA NSCLC. All patients had integrated FDG-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) performed in our center as part of the preoperative workup within one month of resection. The relationships between the SUVmax and pathologic results of lymph node metastasis, intratumoral lymphatic and vascular invasion of tumor cells, and pleural invasion were examined. Compared with tumors with an SUVmax < or = 2.0, tumors with an SUVmax>2.0 had more frequent lymph node metastasis, intratumoral lymphatic and vascular invasion of tumor cells and pleural invasion (all P<0.05). Our results suggest that in patients with clinical stage IA NSCLC, SUVmax is an important predictor of tumor invasiveness."

On this basis, many screening programmes adjust the marker levels to take account of this difference. Recent studies suggested that the marker levels were not different, and so adjustment may no longer be needed, possibly because of better diabetic control. Data from a prenatal screening programme for Down syndrome were examined to see whether the median values of second-trimester screening markers were still reduced in pregnant women with IDDM. A total of 366 women with IDDM singleton pregnancies without Down syndrome were identified from the screening programme at Barts from 1989 to 2002. After allowing for maternal weight, the median multiples of the median (MoM) for IDDM-unaffected singleton pregnancies were as follows: 0.88 (95% confidence interval 0.84-0.93) for alphafetoprotein (AFP), 0.95 (0.91-0.99) for unconjugated oestriol (uE3), 0.90 (0.80-1.01) for total human chorionic gonadotrophin (total hCG), 0.98 (0.88-1.08) for free beta-hCG, and 0.99 (0.89-1.10) for inhibin-A. The median levels for AFP and uE3 were statistically significantly lower in pregnant women with IDDM. The other markers were not significantly different in women with and without IDDM. There remains a case for adjusting AFP and uE3 levels in women with IDDM in prenatal screening programmes for Down syndrome."

When fetal nuchal translucency was combined with maternal serum free-beta-human chorionic gonadotropin and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A in prospective studies in a total of 44,613 pregnancies, including 215 fetuses with trisomy 21, the detection rate was 87.0% for a false-positive rate of 5.0%. Studies from specialist centers with 15,822 pregnancies, which included 397 fetuses with trisomy 21, have demonstrated that the absence of the nasal bone can identify 69.0% of trisomy 21 fetuses, which represents a false-positive rate of 1.4%. It has been estimated that first-trimester screening by a combination of sonography and maternal serum testing can identify 97% of trisomy 21 fetuses, which represents a false-positive rate of 5%, or that the detection rate can be 91%, which represents a false-positive rate of 0.5%. In addition to increased nuchal translucency, important sonographic markers for chromosomal abnormalities, include fetal growth restriction, tachycardia, abnormal flow in the ductus venosus, megacystis, exomphalos and single umbilical artery. Most pregnant women prefer screening in the first, rather than in the second, trimester. As with all aspects of good clinical practice, those care givers who perform first-trimester screening should be trained appropriately, and their results should be subjected to external quality assurance."
CD011975,First trimester serum tests for Down's syndrome screening," The aim of this review was to estimate and compare the accuracy of first trimester serum markers for the detection of Down’s syndrome in the antenatal period, both as individual markers and as combinations of markers. Accuracy is described by the proportion of fetuses with Down’s syndrome detected by screening before birth (sensitivity or detection rate), and the proportion of women with a low risk (normal) screening test result who subsequently had a baby unaffected by Down's syndrome (specificity). Investigation of sources of heterogeneity We planned to investigate whether a uniform screening test is suitable for all women, or whether different screening methods are more applicable to different groups, defined by advanced maternal age, ethnic groups and aspects of the pregnancy and medical history such as multiple pregnancy, diabetes and family history of Down's syndrome. We also considered whether there existed evidence of overestimation of test accuracy in studies evaluating risk equations in the derivation sample rather than in a separate validation sample.",7677679,1,Maternal serum screening and routine 18-week ultrasound in the detection of all chromosomal abnormalities.,"Over a 15-month period, maternal serum screening (alpha fetoprotein, oestriol, chorionic gonadotrophin) and ultrasound were evaluated in the detection of all chromosomal abnormalities. Of the 981 screened, there were 8 chromosomally abnormal pregnancies. Six of these were considered to be at increased risk on serum screening, all of which were detected. Of the remaining 2, one was detected by ultrasound and the other resulted in a liveborn baby with trisomy 21. The positive and negative predictive values for serum screening for all chromosomal abnormalities was 7.8% and 99.9% respectively. The sensitivity and specificity was 87.5% and 91.5% respectively. Serum screening is useful in the detection of many chromosomal abnormalities, not just Down syndrome. The combination of maternal serum screening and ultrasound has a high negative predictive value and is valuable in providing reassurance of no underlying chromosomal abnormality. With a positive predictive value of 7.8% a chromosomal abnormality will be found once in every 13 amniocenteses performed."

We examine associations between (11)C-PiB-PET measurement of Aβ burden and brain volume changes in the preceding years in 57 non-demented individuals (age 64-86; M=78.7). Participants were prospectively followed through the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, with up to 10 consecutive MRI scans (M=8.1) and an (11)C-PiB scan approximately 10 years after the initial MRI. Linear mixed effects models were used to determine whether mean cortical (11)C-PiB distribution volume ratios, estimated by fitting a reference tissue model to the measured time activity curves, were associated with longitudinal regional brain volume changes of the whole brain, ventricular CSF, frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital white and gray matter, the hippocampus, orbito-frontal cortex, and the precuneus. Despite significant longitudinal declines in the volumes of all investigated regions (p<0.05), no associations were detected between current Aβ burden and regional brain volume decline trajectories in the preceding years, nor did the regional volume trajectories differ between those with highest and lowest Aβ burden. Consistent with a threshold model of disease, our findings suggest that Aβ load does not seem to affect brain volume changes in individuals without dementia."

In this study, we used PCR and ISH to detect human papillomavirus (HPV) in cytologic and histologic specimens, respectively. By using positive and negative likelihood ratios, we attempted to identify any predictive role of ISH testing alone or in combination with PCR for the development of high-grade histologic lesions (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] 2+). In our study, ISH was a useful method for detection of HPV, even in a large fraction of samples with normal cytologic or biopsy findings. We suggest that when used together and evaluated in conjunction with histologic sections, ISH is a useful tool for ancillary molecular testing of HPV infection in cervical lesions, especially in CIN 2+ histological lesions where its analytic sensitivities and specificities were as good as those of PCR testing."

Mean midband fit, slope, intercept, and correlation coefficient from a linear regression of the calibrated RF power spectra were computed over regions of interest defined by the endoscopist. Linear discriminant analysis was then performed to develop a classification of the resulting spectral parameters. For lymph nodes, classification based on the midband fit and intercept provided 67% sensitivity, 82% specificity, and 73% accuracy for malignant vs. benign nodes. For pancreas, classification based on midband fit and correlation coefficient provided 95% sensitivity, 93% specificity, and 93% accuracy for diseased vs. normal pancreas and 85% sensitivity, 71% specificity, and 85% accuracy for pancreatic cancer vs. chronic pancreatitis. These promising results suggest that mean spectral parameters can provide a non-invasive method to quantitatively characterize pancreatic cancer and lymph malignancy in vivo."

Preoperative radiographic determination of IPMN type is heavily relied upon in oncologic risk stratification. We hypothesized that radiographic assessment of MPD involvement in IPMN is an accurate predictor of pathological MPD involvement. Data regarding all patients undergoing resection for IPMN at a single academic institution between 1992 and 2012 were gathered prospectively. Retrospective analysis of imaging and pathologic data was undertaken. Preoperative classification of IPMN type was based on cross-sectional imaging (MRI/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and/or CT). Three hundred sixty-two patients underwent resection for IPMN. Of these, 334 had complete data for analysis. Of 164 suspected branch duct (BD) IPMN, 34 (20.7%) demonstrated MPD involvement on final pathology. Of 170 patients with suspicion of MPD involvement, 50 (29.4%) demonstrated no MPD involvement. Of 34 patients with suspected BD-IPMN who were found to have MPD involvement on pathology, 10 (29.4%) had invasive carcinoma. Alternatively, 2/50 (4%) of the patients with suspected MPD involvement who ultimately had isolated BD-IPMN demonstrated invasive carcinoma. Preoperative radiographic IPMN type did not correlate with final pathology in 25% of the patients. In addition, risk of invasive carcinoma correlates with pathologic presence of MPD involvement."

For the differentiation of benign from malignant mass lesions, however, cytological examination is still recommended. As transcutaneous fine-needle biopsies have a limited diagnostic value, we have evaluated the efficiency of transmural (trangastral, transduodenal) endosonographically guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-guided FNA) puncture for cytological confirmation of such pancreatic mass lesions. EUS-guided FNA puncture was performed in 11 patients with focal pancreatic solid lesions. In 4 patients a malignant mass lesion and in 2 patients a benign lesion were correctly identified by EUS-guided FNA puncture, while in 4 patients a false benign diagnosis was established and in 1 patient with a malignant mass lesion a sufficient cytological sample could not be obtained. Histological confirmation or rejection of the cytological diagnosis gained by EUS-guided FNA puncture was obtained in all patients by surgical biopsy or resection. It is concluded that transmural EUS-guided FNA puncture-with the application of a curved-array EUS transducer scanning parallel to the axis of the endoscope-is a new approach to the cytological diagnosis of pancreatic mass lesions. However, the of flexible puncture needles with a short needle tip-destined for multiple use-results in a considerable amount of false-negative diagnoses, as the needle tip frequently can only be advanced into the margin of the lesion. New prototypes of aspiration needles with an extending steel are presently under study for improved transmural EUS-guided FNA puncture."

The aim of this study was to retrospectively examine these abnormalities using fluorescence in situ hybridization. IPMNs (n=28) were histopathologically classified into noninvasive IPMN (n=17) and IPMN with an associated invasive carcinoma (invasive IPMN, n=11) groups. Noninvasive IPMNs possessed non-neoplastic and noninvasive spots in their tissues, and invasive IPMN cases possessed non-neoplastic, noninvasive, and invasive spots. Non-neoplastic (n=28), noninvasive (n=28), and invasive (n=11) spots were then analyzed for aneuploidy of chromosomes 3, 6, 7, 8, 17, and 18 and deletions of p16 and p53 loci. Polysomy 6 and p16 deletion were significantly more frequent in noninvasive than in non-neoplastic spots. Polysomy 7, polysomy 18, p16 deletion, and p53 deletion were significantly more frequent in invasive than in noninvasive spots. Detection of polysomy 7 and p53 deletion gave a high diagnostic accuracy for invasive IPMN (sensitivity, 90.9%; specificity, 94.1%; and accuracy, 92.5%). Our study suggests that: (1) polysomy 6 and p16 deletion may contribute to adenomatous change of IPMN; (2) polysomy 7, polysomy 18, p16 deletion, and p53 deletion play roles in malignant transformation of noninvasive IPMN; and (3) polysomy 7 and p53 deletion may be excellent diagnostic markers for invasive IPMN.

The authors investigated the characteristics of Br-IPMN and explored its malignancy or invasiveness predicting factors to suggest a scoring formula for predicting pathologic results. From 1994 to 2008, 237 patients who were diagnosed as Br-IPMN at 11 tertiary referral centers in Korea were retrospectively reviewed. The patients' mean age was 63.1 ± 9.2 yr. One hundred ninty-eight (83.5%) patients had nonmalignant IPMN (81 adenoma, 117 borderline atypia), and 39 (16.5%) had malignant IPMN (13 carcinoma in situ, 26 invasive carcinoma). Cyst size and mural nodule were malignancy determining factors by multivariate analysis. Elevated CEA, cyst size and mural nodule were factors determining invasiveness by multivariate analysis. Using the regression coefficient for significant predictors on multivariate analysis, we constructed a malignancy-predicting scoring formula: 22.4 (mural nodule [0 or 1]) + 0.5 (cyst size [mm]). In invasive IPMN, the formula was expressed as invasiveness-predicting score = 36.6 (mural nodule [0 or 1]) + 32.2 (elevated serum CEA [0 or 1]) + 0.6 (cyst size [mm]). Here we present a scoring formula for prediction of malignancy or invasiveness of Br-IPMN which can be used to determine a proper treatment strategy."

A multiple electrode aggregometry study.,"Platelets play a central role in coagulation. Currently, information on platelet function following trauma is limited. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients admitted to the emergency room (ER) at the AUVA Trauma Centre, Salzburg, after sustaining traumatic injury. Immediately after admission to the ER, blood was drawn for blood cell counts, standard coagulation tests, and platelet function testing. Platelet function was assessed by multiplate electrode aggregometry (MEA) using adenosine diphosphate (ADPtest), collagen (COLtest) and thrombin receptor activating peptide-6 (TRAPtest) as activators. The thromboelastometric platelet component, measuring the contribution of platelets to the elasticity of the whole-blood clot, was assessed using the ROTEM device. The study included 163 patients, 79.7% were male, and the median age was 43 years. The median injury severity score was 18. Twenty patients (12.3%) died. Median platelet count was significantly lower among non-survivors than survivors (181,000/μl vs. 212,000/μl; p=0.01). Although platelet function defects were relatively minor, significant differences between survivors and non-survivors were observed in the ADPtest (94 vs. 79 U; p=0.0019), TRAPtest (136 vs. 115 U; p<0.0001), and platelet component (134 vs.103 MCEEXTEM - MCEFIBTEM; p=0.0012). Aggregometry values below the normal range for ADPtest and TRAPtest were significantly more frequent in non-survivors than in survivors (p=0.0017 and p=0.0002, respectively). Minor decreases in platelet function upon admission to the ER were a sign of coagulopathy accompanying increased mortality in patients with trauma. Further studies are warranted to confirm these results and investigate the role of platelet function in trauma haemostatic management."

Rapid thrombelastography (RapidTEG) is a new variant of thrombelastography (TEG), in which coagulation is initiated by the addition of protein tissue factor. The kinetics of coagulation and the times of measurement were compared for two variants of TEG--RapidTEG and conventional TEG, in which coagulation was initiated with kaolin. The measurements were performed on blood samples from 20 patients with multiple injuries. The RapidTEG results were also compared with conventional measurements of blood coagulation. The mean time for the RapidTEG test was 19.2 +/- 3.1 minutes (mean +/- SD), in comparison with 29.9 +/- 4.3 minutes for kaolin TEG and 34.1 +/- 14.5 minutes for conventional coagulation tests. The mean time for the RapidTEG test was 30.8 +/- 5.72 minutes, in comparison with 41.5 +/- 5.66 minutes for kaolin TEG and 64.9 +/- 18.8 for conventional coagulation tests---measured from admission of the patients to the resuscitation bay until the results were available. There were significant correlations between the RapidTEG results and those from kaolin TEG and conventional coagulation tests. RapidTEG is the most rapid available test for providing reliable information on coagulopathy in patients with multiple injuries. This has implications for improving patient care."

Fifty-two children <2 years of age with UTI were enrolled in the study, 44 of whom were febrile. The control group consisted of 23 patients with non-UTI infection and elevated serum CRP (s-CRP) levels. Thirty-six patients had abnormal DMSA uptake, classified as mild, moderate or severe damage (DMSA class 1, 2, 3, respectively). There was a significant association between DMSA class and the excretion of urinary RBP (u-RBP) and u-CC16. There was also a significant difference in u-CRP levels between children with UTI and control children with non-UTI infections, although u-CRP excretion was not significantly correlated to DMSA class. In conclusion, the urinary excretion of the low-molecular-weight proteins RBP and CC16 showed a strong association with uptake defects on renal DMSA scans. The urinary level of CRP seems to distinguish between children with UTI and other febrile conditions. A combination of these biomarkers may be useful in the clinical assessment of children with UTI."

We tested the hypothesis that the combination of memory and brain metabolic assessment could identify subgroups of memory decliners (MCI/Decl) and non-decliners (MCI/noDecl) before a long follow-up time is available. From twenty-nine patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI) at baseline, three groups were identified at follow-up: 10 patients who converted to AD (MCI/AD); 10 patients either showing episodic memory worsening or reaching the floor effect on memory and declining in other key tests (MCI/Decl) and 9 patients showing no memory worsening or even improvement (MCI/noDecl). They were compared with a group of fourteen elderly controls (CTR) by means of basal FDG-PET voxel-based analysis (SPM2). Two hypometabolic clusters were found in MCI/AD versus CTR, including the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex, the left parietal precuneus and the left fusiform gyrus. MCI/AD showed also a large hypometabolic region, mainly including the left medium and superior temporal gyri and inferior parietal lobule, when compared to MCI/noDecl. The MCI/Decl showed a hypometabolic region in the left medial temporal lobe versus both CTR (hippocampus) and MCI/noDecl (parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus). No significant difference was found in the comparison between CTR and MCI/noDecl, neither in the comparison between MCI/Decl and MCI/AD. Thus, non converter MCI patients comprised a sub-group of 'decliners' with AD-like metabolic and cognitive patterns, likely including 'late converters', and a sub-group lacking this pattern, with stable or improving memory function and a brain metabolic picture similar to that in healthy controls. Combining neuropsychological and FDG-PET information could be used for prognostic purposes in aMCI patients at medium-term follow-up."

However, despite extensive studies its etiology and pathogenesis are not completely understood. Differentially expressed genes were investigated in epithelial and stromal cells from deep endometriosis and matched eutopic endometrium using cDNA microarrays and laser capture microdissection. Validation of results of several up- and down-regulated genes was performed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Our data showed that platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA), protein kinase C beta1 (PKC beta1) and janus kinase 1 (JAK1) were upregulated, and Sprouty2 and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7 (MKK7) were downregulated in endometriosis stromal cells, suggesting the involvement of the RAS/RAF/MAPK signaling pathway through PDGFRA in endometriosis pathophysiology. In addition, two potential negative regulators of aromatase expression, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor 2 (COUP-TF2) and prostaglandin E2 receptor subtype EP3 (PGE2EP3), were downregulated in endometriosis epithelial cells, which might result in increased local production of estrogen in endometriosis epithelial cells. Furthermore, three potential candidate genes that might be involved in endometriosis related pain were identified: tyrosine kinase receptor B (TRkB) in endometriosis epithelial cells, and serotonin transporter (5HTT) and mu opioid receptor (MOR) in endometriosis stromal cells were all upregulated. One of the candidate genes, MOR, may be involved in a defective immune system in endometriosis. This study has provided new insights into endometriosis pathophysiology."

AIF-1 is expressed in various human immune-related tissues and is thought to play a role in inflammatory responses and the immune activation and function of macrophages. Expression has also been shown in human placentas and bovine embryos, suggesting that AIF-1 may be involved in reproductive function. Immune factors are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. High concentrations of activated macrophages and various cytokines have been found in the peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis. In the current work we examined the expression of AIF-1 in human eutopic endometrium and endometriosis, and measured AIF-1 in peritoneal fluid samples from women with and without endometriosis. RT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry showed that AIF-1 mRNA and protein were expressed both in eutopic endometrium and in endometriotic tissue. In eutopic endometrium, expression was greater in the late secretory and menstrual phases than in other phases of the menstrual cycle (P < 0.01). AIF-1 protein was present in greater amounts in peritoneal fluid from patients with endometriosis than in women without it (P < 0.01), and its concentration correlated with the Revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine score (rs = 0.693; P < 0.0001). Peritoneal macrophages from endometriosis patients secreted more AIF-1 than those from unaffected women (P < 0.05). AIF-1 release from macrophages was stimulated by IL-1beta (P < 0.01) and interferon-gamma (P < 0.05). These results demonstrate for the first time that AIF-1 is expressed in eutopic endometrium and endometriotic tissue, suggesting that AIF-1 is one cytokine in the local network involved in the onset of menstruation. AIF-1 derived from peritoneal macrophages may also possibly play a significant role in the pathophysiology and progression of endometriosis."

Recent studies suggest that resistance to progesterone action may contribute to the development and pathophysiology of this disorder. In this study we examined the in vivo and in vitro expression and function of one progesterone receptor (PR) coactivator, Hic-5, in human endometrium and endometrial stromal fibroblasts (hESFs) from 29 women with and 30 (control) women without endometriosis. Hic-5 was highly expressed in stromal, but not epithelial, cells in women without endometriosis, in a cycle-dependent manner. In contrast, Hic-5 expression was not regulated during the menstrual cycle in hESFs from women with endometriosis and was significantly reduced in hESFs from women with vs. without disease. Hic-5 mRNA expression throughout the cycle in endometrium from control women, but not those with endometriosis, correlated with expression of PR. Hic-5 mRNA in hESFs was significantly up-regulated in control but not endometriosis hESFs after treatment in vitro with 8-bromoadenosine-cAMP for 96 h but only modestly after 14 d of progesterone treatment. Hic-5 silencing did not influence cAMP-regulated gene expression but affected genes regulated solely by progesterone (e.g. DKK1 and calcitonin). Together the data suggest that the proposed progesterone resistance in endometrium from women with endometriosis derives, in part, from impaired expression of the PR coactivator, Hic-5, in endometrial tissue and cultured endometrial stromal fibroblasts."

A significant correlation was found between haematuria, proteinuria, leucocyturia and intensity of infection as measured by egg excretion in urine. The best correlation between the reagent strip findings and intensity of infection was obtained when the three parameters were combined. After treatment with metrifonate the reduction of egg excretion was paralleled by the normalization of the reagent strip findings. Analysis of day-to-day variation demonstrated a similar low variation of the filtration technique and the reagent strip findings. Specificity of urine analysis of reagent strips was tested in two age-matched control groups. Although the study was designed only as a pilot study, the results suggests that polyvalent reagent strips may be a useful tool for diagnosis of heavily infected patients under field conditions, as they permit rapid and easy identification of subjects with high egg counts."

CD011912,Pulse oximetry screening for critical congenital heart defects, To determine the diagnostic accuracy of pulse oximetry as a screening method for detection of CCHD in asymptomatic newborn infants,18347842,1,The reliability of a single pulse oximetry reading as a screening test for congenital heart disease in otherwise asymptomatic newborn infants.,"Routine pulse oximetry has been studied to detect children with otherwise undiagnosed congenital heart disease prior to nursery discharge. The reported sensitivities in asymptomatic patients have been less than expected and vary widely, bringing into question the reliability of the test. The purpose of this study was to assess whether routine pulse oximetry contributes to identifying patients with critical congenital heart disease and to determine the reliability of a single pulse oximeter reading in screening asymptomatic newborn infants. Between December 26, 2003, and December 31, 2005, three hospitals in west central Florida performed a pulse oximetry routinely on all newborns at the time of discharge. Patients diagnosed with critical congenital heart disease during the study period were identified to assess whether the pulse oximetry reading initiated their diagnosis. In one hospital, the pulse oximeter data were evaluated for reliability. Downloaded data were compared to a log compiled by the nursery personnel, first without (phase 1) and then with (phase 2) their knowledge and additional training. Results were characterized as reliable, probe placed but reading not verifiable, or no evidence of probe placement. Of the 7962 infants who received oximetry testing, there were 12 postnatal diagnoses of critical congenital heart disease. None was initially identified by routine pulse oximetry. Pulse oximetry reliability improved substantially between phase 1 and phase 2 (38 v. 60%, p < 0.0001). Optimal reliability (>95%) was obtained by a nurse with a degree of LPN or higher performing an assessment of at least 360 seconds. Routine pulse oximetry was neither reliable nor an important diagnostic tool in our cohort. Important human factors (probe placement time, oximetry training, and nursing degree) impact single determination pulse oximetry reliability. With routine surveillance and quality improvement, the reliability of this test can be increased. Future studies to determine the effectiveness of pulse oximetry screening for the diagnosis of congenital heart disease in the asymptomatic newborn population must address these factors. Until such a study demonstrates acceptable sensitivity and clinical value, universal screening should not be instituted."

On this basis, many screening programmes adjust the marker levels to take account of this difference. Recent studies suggested that the marker levels were not different, and so adjustment may no longer be needed, possibly because of better diabetic control. Data from a prenatal screening programme for Down syndrome were examined to see whether the median values of second-trimester screening markers were still reduced in pregnant women with IDDM. A total of 366 women with IDDM singleton pregnancies without Down syndrome were identified from the screening programme at Barts from 1989 to 2002. After allowing for maternal weight, the median multiples of the median (MoM) for IDDM-unaffected singleton pregnancies were as follows: 0.88 (95% confidence interval 0.84-0.93) for alphafetoprotein (AFP), 0.95 (0.91-0.99) for unconjugated oestriol (uE3), 0.90 (0.80-1.01) for total human chorionic gonadotrophin (total hCG), 0.98 (0.88-1.08) for free beta-hCG, and 0.99 (0.89-1.10) for inhibin-A. The median levels for AFP and uE3 were statistically significantly lower in pregnant women with IDDM. The other markers were not significantly different in women with and without IDDM. There remains a case for adjusting AFP and uE3 levels in women with IDDM in prenatal screening programmes for Down syndrome."

Of the 981 screened, there were 8 chromosomally abnormal pregnancies. Six of these were considered to be at increased risk on serum screening, all of which were detected. Of the remaining 2, one was detected by ultrasound and the other resulted in a liveborn baby with trisomy 21. The positive and negative predictive values for serum screening for all chromosomal abnormalities was 7.8% and 99.9% respectively. The sensitivity and specificity was 87.5% and 91.5% respectively. Serum screening is useful in the detection of many chromosomal abnormalities, not just Down syndrome. The combination of maternal serum screening and ultrasound has a high negative predictive value and is valuable in providing reassurance of no underlying chromosomal abnormality. With a positive predictive value of 7.8% a chromosomal abnormality will be found once in every 13 amniocenteses performed."

Prospective studies in a total of 200,868 pregnancies, including 871 fetuses with trisomy 21, have demonstrated that increased nuchal translucency can identify 76.8% of fetuses with trisomy 21, which represents a false-positive rate of 4.2%. When fetal nuchal translucency was combined with maternal serum free-beta-human chorionic gonadotropin and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A in prospective studies in a total of 44,613 pregnancies, including 215 fetuses with trisomy 21, the detection rate was 87.0% for a false-positive rate of 5.0%. Studies from specialist centers with 15,822 pregnancies, which included 397 fetuses with trisomy 21, have demonstrated that the absence of the nasal bone can identify 69.0% of trisomy 21 fetuses, which represents a false-positive rate of 1.4%. It has been estimated that first-trimester screening by a combination of sonography and maternal serum testing can identify 97% of trisomy 21 fetuses, which represents a false-positive rate of 5%, or that the detection rate can be 91%, which represents a false-positive rate of 0.5%. In addition to increased nuchal translucency, important sonographic markers for chromosomal abnormalities, include fetal growth restriction, tachycardia, abnormal flow in the ductus venosus, megacystis, exomphalos and single umbilical artery. Most pregnant women prefer screening in the first, rather than in the second, trimester. As with all aspects of good clinical practice, those care givers who perform first-trimester screening should be trained appropriately, and their results should be subjected to external quality assurance."

Between 1992 and 1996, maternal serum markers were evaluated in 1406 women who had amniocentesis for prenatal diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities related to a maternal age of 35 or more years. Sixteen fetuses with Down's syndrome were identified in the whole group by amniocentesis and karyotyping. The group with negative triple test screening consisted of 919 pregnancies and included two fetuses with trisomy-21 (false negatives). With triple test screening in the age group over 35, there was a detection rate of 87.5% for cut-off points ranging from 1:200 up to 1:350, with corresponding false positive rates ranging between 23% and 34%. In our population, if we had practiced the policy of offering amniocentesis only to women screening positive for the ages of 35 and 36 and to all pregnant women of 37 or more, we would have carried out 30% less amniocenteses. In this group of 1406 women, 33 abnormal karyotypes were detected with amniocentesis (16 Down's syndrome included) and equal number of elective abortions were carried out. Nevertheless, 19 healthy fetuses and neonates were lost after amniocentesis. Considering the high detection rates that can be achieved with triple test screening, the existing procedure related risk of amniocentesis (0.5-1.0%), and the facts that conception in women over 35 years of age is usually more difficult and the background loss usually higher than in younger women, we believe that in the future women over 35 should be offered a choice between non-invasive and invasive procedures after being thoroughly informed."

Invasive investigation may identify those at risk of cardiac death during or after renal transplantation, but which patients should undergo cardiac catheterization is currently not clear. In 95 patients awaiting renal transplantation we assessed the ability of echocardiography and exercise electrocardiography to identify patients at risk of cardiac death. Echocardiography identified impaired left ventricular (LV) systolic function in 20%, severe in 8%. Of the patients with severe LV dysfunction, 25% died before transplantation. Of those undergoing exercise electrocardiography, 44% did not achieve 85% of maximum predicted heart rate. No coronary artery disease requiring intervention was identified by exercise testing. These findings indicate that echocardiography, but not exercise electrocardiography, should be part of the assessment for renal transplantation."

One hundred and twenty patients who underwent arthroscopic treatment for acromioplasty or cuff repair were previously submitted to a new test of resistance. The test is performed in the standing position with the involved arm in 90 degrees abduction, 20 degrees -30 degrees anteposition and in external rotation (as for full-can test). Thus, the patient was invited to follow the way of a spiral drawn on a drawing sheet for 20 turns; 1 turn = from the centre to the end of the spiral and vice versa (spiral width = 20 cm). The test was considered positive when the patient was not able to conclude it due to strength decrease or to shoulder pain. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values as well as diagnostic accuracy were calculated for our test of resistance. The test resulted scarcely reliable as detector of subacromial impingement and not very reliable as detector of small tear. When the test is positive there is a high probability that a subacromial disease exists; instead, when it is negative there is a high probability that the patient has not a large or massive cuff tear. The resistance test (Gum-Turn test) adds to our armamentarium of physical examination signs in patients with painful shoulder and furnishes further information on possible dimensions of tendinous tear."

A physical therapist and a physical therapist/manual therapist independently performed a physical examination of the shoulder girdle in 91 patients with shoulder complaints of varying severity and duration. The observers assessed 23 items in total: active and passive abductions, passive external rotation, hand in neck (HIN) test, hand in back (HIB) test, impingement test according to Neer, springing test of the first rib and joint play test of the acromioclavicular joint. The interobserver reliability was evaluated by means of a Cohen's Kappa, the weighted Kappa and the intraclass correlation (ICC). Criteria for acceptable reliability were: Kappa value>or=0.60, ICC>or=0.75 or an absolute agreement>or=80%. The results showed that Kappa values varied from 0.09 (springing test first rib, stiffness) to 0.66 (springing test first rib, pain), weighted Kappa varied from 0.35 (pain during HIB) to 0.73 (range of motion HIB) and ICC varied from 0.54 (abduction passive starting point painful arc) to 0.96 (active and passive ranges of motion in abduction). In total 11 (48%) items fulfilled the criteria of acceptable reliability. In conclusion, there appears to be a great deal of variation in the reliability of the tests used in the physical examination of the shoulder girdle. Over 50% of the tests did not meet the statistical criteria for acceptable reliability."

We did a systematic review to assess the specificity and sensitivity of diagnostic techniques in different settings, using a statistical method that avoided defining a gold standard. Performance varied depending on species of the malaria parasite, level of parasitaemia, and immunity. Overall, histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2)-based dipsticks showed a high sensitivity (92.7%) and specificity (99.2%) for Plasmodium falciparum in endemic areas. The acridine orange test was more sensitive (97.1%) in detecting P falciparum in epidemiological studies, with a specificity of 97.9%.

Although microscopy is gold standard in malaria diagnosis, its reliability is largely dependent on user skill. In this study, we evaluated practitioners' clinical and microscopists' technical skills in diagnosis of malaria in central Sudan. In a retrospective study, 3203 blood smears from 95 peripheral health facilities (each represented by a general practitioner [GP] and general microscopist [GM]) were reexamined by expert microscopist. Furthermore, in a prospective study, 410 patients had their malaria diagnosis rechecked by rapid diagnostic test for validation of the microscopic diagnosis. Results showed that the rate of false-positive diagnosis of malaria was 75.6% and false-negative diagnosis was 0.01%. The study disclosed poor skills of the GPs and GMs in malaria diagnosis because 43% of the GPs and 44% of the GMs failed to make a single true-positive malaria diagnosis. The false-positive malaria diagnosis showed bias toward adult females. Economically, the calculated cost of diagnosis and treatment of malaria in Sudan in year 2000 is US$100 million, whereas the calculated cost of true malaria is approximately US$14 million. In conclusion, malaria overdiagnosis was widely recognized in central Sudan, with high economic burden during the era of artemisinin-based combination therapy.

The parasitemia in patients with false negative Parasight-F tests ranged from 319 to 54,680 parasites/microL of blood. Detailed PCR analysis of Isolates obtained from five out of the eight patients who exhibited a negative Parasight-F test, showed that the average numbers of P. falciparum clones in these five isolates were: 1.7 +/- 1.02 with MSPI, 3.2 +/- 1.3 with MSP2 and 1.4 +/- 1.72 with GLURP. Comparison of microscopy and HRPII results showed a significant (p=0.009) difference as opposed to microscopy and PCR (p=0.239).

There have been a number of RDTs developed and evaluated widely for malaria diagnosis, but a number of issues related to these products have arisen. This review highlights RDTs, including challenges in assessing their performance, internationally available RDTs, their effectiveness in various health care settings, and the selection of RDTs for different health care systems."

KAT test results were compared with microscopy on 90 consecutive patients hospitalized at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand. Fifty-one patients had P. falciparum infections while 49 had malaria due to other plasmodium species. For a geometric mean +/-SD (Min;Max;range) parasitemia of 11,481 +/- 5.0 (88;713,838;713,750), the sensitivity of the KAT test was 96% (95% CI = 86-99.5), the specificity was 92% (95% CI = 80-99), the accuracy was 94% and the reliability was 85%. These findings suggest that the KAT test is of potential interest in the diagnosis of falciparum malaria in Thailand."

The prevalence of P. falciparum infections in enrolled patients was 100% by microscopy. Parasite density ranged from 329 to 81,194 parasites/microL of blood, with a geometric mean parasite density of 5168 parasites/microL of blood. The sensitivity of the HRPII based dipstick, PCR and microscopy were 80%, 92% and 100% respectively. A false negative rate of 20% was observed with Parasight-F as compared with microscopy. The parasitemia in patients with false negative Parasight-F tests ranged from 319 to 54,680 parasites/microL of blood. Detailed PCR analysis of Isolates obtained from five out of the eight patients who exhibited a negative Parasight-F test, showed that the average numbers of P. falciparum clones in these five isolates were: 1.7 +/- 1.02 with MSPI, 3.2 +/- 1.3 with MSP2 and 1.4 +/- 1.72 with GLURP. Comparison of microscopy and HRPII results showed a significant (p=0.009) difference as opposed to microscopy and PCR (p=0.239). This study showed that caution should be exercised when excluding P. falciparum infections on the basis of HRPII based dipstick results alone. Microscopy or PCR diagnosis where possible, should be carried out in order to confirm negative P. falciparum HRPII-based dipstick tests."

However, microscopy is prone to error and therefore makes it difficult to assess the reliability of other diagnostic techniques. We did a systematic review to assess the specificity and sensitivity of diagnostic techniques in different settings, using a statistical method that avoided defining a gold standard. Performance varied depending on species of the malaria parasite, level of parasitaemia, and immunity. Overall, histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2)-based dipsticks showed a high sensitivity (92.7%) and specificity (99.2%) for Plasmodium falciparum in endemic areas. The acridine orange test was more sensitive (97.1%) in detecting P falciparum in epidemiological studies, with a specificity of 97.9%. In the absence of a gold standard, HRP2 dipsticks and acridine orange could provide an alternative for detecting falciparum infections in endemic areas and epidemiological studies, respectively. Microscopy still remains more reliable in detecting non-falciparum infections."

Of the 98 febrile patients screened, 22 were ICT positive for P. falciparum. Simultaneous microscopic examination of the blood smears of these ICT positive patients showed that 20 were positive for P. falciparum alone, whereas one had mix infection of both P. vivax and P. falciparum suggesting 100% sensitivity. Only one slide negative patient who had taken 600 mg chloroquine the previous day was positive in the ICT. Out of the remaining 76 blood smears, 41 showed P. vivax infection and none cross-reacted with P. falciparum HRP-2 antigen and were ICT negative except one mix infection case in which P. vivax and P. falciparum infections occurred concomitantly suggesting species specificity of 98.7%. The positive predictive value, negative predictive value and efficacy of the ICT were 95.4, 100 and 98.9% respectively. The band intensity of the ICT positive cases significantly correlated with P. falciparum parasitaemia (p < 0.01). The usefulness and the disadvantages of this diagnostic kit have been discussed in context of prevailing malaria situation in the country."

Although microscopy is gold standard in malaria diagnosis, its reliability is largely dependent on user skill. In this study, we evaluated practitioners' clinical and microscopists' technical skills in diagnosis of malaria in central Sudan. In a retrospective study, 3203 blood smears from 95 peripheral health facilities (each represented by a general practitioner [GP] and general microscopist [GM]) were reexamined by expert microscopist. Furthermore, in a prospective study, 410 patients had their malaria diagnosis rechecked by rapid diagnostic test for validation of the microscopic diagnosis. Results showed that the rate of false-positive diagnosis of malaria was 75.6% and false-negative diagnosis was 0.01%. The study disclosed poor skills of the GPs and GMs in malaria diagnosis because 43% of the GPs and 44% of the GMs failed to make a single true-positive malaria diagnosis. The false-positive malaria diagnosis showed bias toward adult females. Economically, the calculated cost of diagnosis and treatment of malaria in Sudan in year 2000 is US$100 million, whereas the calculated cost of true malaria is approximately US$14 million. In conclusion, malaria overdiagnosis was widely recognized in central Sudan, with high economic burden during the era of artemisinin-based combination therapy. Finally, different scenarios were suggested for improvement of malaria diagnosis."

To evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the LightCycler PCR for the diagnosis of IA, 536 blood samples were collected over a 22-month period from 62 paediatric patients (median age 10 years, range 1-18) considered at risk of IA. The galactomannan antigen (GM) and fungal DNA were assessed on serial blood samples. IA was diagnosed in eight of 62 patients (13%): proven, five, probable, three. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of LightCycler PCR varied according to the number of positive samples used to define positivity: 88%; 37%; 17% and 95% for single sample positivity; and 63%, 81%, 33% and 94% for serial sample positivity respectively. The concordance between positivity of LightCycler PCR assay and the diagnosis of IA was 79%. The single positivity of LightCycler PCR assay showed a good sensitivity for the diagnosis of IA in paediatric patients. The high NPV makes LightCycler PCR a promising tool in addition to GM testing to design a strategy of pre-emptive antifungal therapy, although further validation studies are needed."

The theory that adrenocortical organ homeostasis is maintained by undifferentiated stem or progenitor cells can be traced back nearly a century. Similar to other organ systems, it is widely believed that these rare cells of the adrenal cortex remain relatively undifferentiated and quiescent until needed to replenish the organ, at which time they undergo proliferation and terminal differentiation. Historical studies examining cell cycle activation by label retention assays and regenerative potential by organ transplantation experiments suggested that the adrenocortical progenitors reside in the outer periphery of the adrenal gland. Over the past decade, the Hammer laboratory, building on this hypothesis and these observations, has endeavored to understand the mechanisms of adrenocortical development and organ maintenance. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of adrenal organogenesis. We present evidence for the existence and location of adrenocortical stem/progenitor cells and their potential contribution to adrenocortical carcinomas. Data described herein come primarily from studies conducted in the Hammer laboratory with incorporation of important related studies from other investigators. Together, the work provides a framework for the emerging somatic stem cell field as it relates to the adrenal gland."

The data were compared with results obtained from patients with glomerular proteinuria and from patients with tubular proteinuria. Initially during acute pancreatitis, the clearance ratio (clearance protein/clearance creatinine) for beta-2-microglobulin was increased dramatically (77-fold) compared to normals. After four to seven days this ratio had fallen and was elevated only 7-fold. The corresponding figures for amylase were 3.3 and 1.8 times and for albumin 9 and 5 times respectively. In glomerular disease, the clearance ratios for beta-2-microglobulin, amylase and albumin were increased 6, 1.1, and 154 times and in tubular disease 448, 1.1, and 28 times, respectively. The electrophoretic pattern of the urinary proteins during pancreatitis was mostly normal. In a few cases, slight tubular proteinuria was noticed. Amylase activity in serum and urine from patients with pancreatitis was found to sediment, (S20,W = 4.6) in a sucrose gradient, identical to amylase from normal serum and urine. The marked increase in the excretion of beta-2-microglobulin probably reflects interference of the kidney function at the proximal tubular level. Determinations of this protein in urine may be of value in studies of kidney dysfunction that can accompany pancreatitis."

E.R.C. gave a significantly higher rate of correct diagnosis of gallbladder calculi (p = 0.026) and common bileduct calculi (p = 0.002) than I.V.C. Biliary stones may thus frequently be present in patients with a normal I.V.C. and E.R.C. may reduce the rate of diagnostic errors in patients with symptoms of biliary disease.

One hundred twenty-five consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy underwent both intraoperative ultrasound and intraoperative cholangiography. Cholangiography required slightly more time to perform; it was more sensitive (92.8% vs 71.4%) but less specific (76.2% vs 100%) for choledocholithiasis than was ultrasound. Ultrasound was somewhat more difficult to perform, and, particularly in the setting of intraabdominal obesity, was often inadequate at providing clear visualization of the intrapancreatic common bile duct. It did not provide the same anatomic definition as an adequate cholangiogram. The overall incidence of choledocholithiasis was 11.2%."

The records of all patients undergoing LC during a five year period were reviewed. Patients with a history of jaundice or pancreatitis, abnormal bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, or radiographic evidence suggestive of choledocholithiasis were considered ""at risk"" for common bile duct stones (CBDS). The remaining patients were considered to be at low ""risk."" LC was attempted on 1002 patients during the study period and successfully completed on 941 (94% of the time). The major complication rate was 3.1% and the common bile duct injury rate 0.1%. Eighty eight (9.5%) patients underwent ERCP, 67 in the preoperative period and 19 in the postoperative period. IOCG was attempted in 272 (24%) patients and completed in 234 for a success rate of 86%. Intraoperative cholangiography (IOCG) and preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) were equivalent in the detection of CBDSs Twelve of the 21 patients (57%) with IOCG positive for stones underwent successful laparoscopic clearance of the common duct, and did not require postop. ERCP. No patients were converted to an open procedure for common bile duct exploration. Because postoperative ERCP was 100% successful in clearing the common duct, reoperation for retained common bile duct stones was not necessary. IOCG is an alternative procedure to ERCP for patients at risk with biochemical, radiological, or clinical evidence of choledocholithiasis. The incidence of CBDS in low-risk patients is 1.7%, a risk that does not warrant routine cholangiography. Preoperative ERCP is recommended in cases of cholangitis unresponsive to antibiotics, suspicion of carcinoma, and biliary pancreatitis unresponsive to supportive care. Although IOCG leads to a similar percentage of nontherapeutic studies as preoperative ERCP, it often allows for one procedure therapy."

The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 plays an important role in eliminating unwanted cells and cellular debris in a silent way. We investigated the modulatory role of IL-10 in the development of endometriosis. We observed that the serum level of IL-10 in patients with endometriosis was significantly higher than that in healthy subjects or in control subjects with other gynecological disease. Monocyte-derived dendritic cells acquired from male donors and subsequently conditioned with serum from women with endometriosis exhibited a tolerogenic phenotype, including increased IL-10 production, lower IL-12 secretion, and down-regulation of CD86 and HLA-DR molecules. Depletion of IL-10 activity in a C57BL/6 mouse model of surgically induced endometriosis significantly decreased the size of endometrial lesions. In contrast, IL-10 administration promoted the growth of endometrial lesions in this model. In addition, infiltrated plasmacytoid dendritic cells were the primary IL-10-secreting immune cells in endometrial lesions. Our findings suggest that IL-10 may suppress immunity against endometrial implants, contributing to development of endometriosis. "

The question whether changes in these parameters in endometriotic lesions were reflected by the level of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) in serum and peritoneal fluid was also studied. Biopsy specimens of both eutopic endometrium and peritoneal endometriotic lesions from women with endometriosis (n = 25) as well as eutopic endometrium from women without endometriosis (n = 14) were analysed immunohistochemically regarding microvessel density, proliferative activity, and expression of VEGF-A and its receptors vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1 and 2 (VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2) in stroma, glands and blood vessels. The VEGF-A concentration was measured in peritoneal fluid and serum. Secretory phase eutopic endometrium from women with endometriosis had significantly higher microvessel density, expression of VEGF-A in glandular epithelium and VEGFR-2 in endometrial blood vessels than those from women without endometriosis. Endometriotic lesions with high proliferative activity had a higher microvessel density and showed higher vascular expression of VEGFR-2 as well as being accompanied by higher levels of VEGF-A in peritoneal fluid and serum, compared with lesions with low proliferative activity. In conclusion, there seems to be a dysregulation of angiogenic activity in the eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis and endometriotic lesions with high proliferative activity were accompanied by higher local angiogenic activity and higher levels of VEGF in serum and peritoneal fluid."

A total of 55 fertile patients with pelvic pain who had endometriosis diagnosed by laparoscopy and confirmed by histology formed the study group, while 43 fertile patients without pelvic pain and undergoing tubal sterilization formed the control group. Eutopic endometrial membrane antigen was prepared from biopsies taken from patients or controls by an ultracentrifugation technique and used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgA and IgM endometrial antibodies. Ovarian, thyroid and skeletal muscle antigens were prepared similarly and used in an ELISA. There was a significant difference in the prevalence of IgG antibodies to eutopic endometrial antigens derived from either control or endometriosis patients (P < 0.05). IgA or IgM antibodies against endometrial antigens were not detected. Endometrial antibodies were detectable in both the luteal and the follicular phases of the menstrual cycle. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated the presence of endometrial antigens with molecular weights of 60 and 66 kDa in the eutopic endometrium of patients with endometriosis.

Evolution of 50 patients with physiotherapy and hydrotherapy in a swimming pool.,"We added hydrotherapy to 50 patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) who were being treated with individual conventional physiotherapy. Hydrotherapy performed at an approximate temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, twice a week, for thirty minutes in children and forty-five minutes in adults during a 2-year period. The outcome derived from this combined modality of treatment was rated according to physiotherapeutic evaluations, the MMT (Manual Muscular Test), and the Barthel Ladder. Patients were reevaluated at 2-month intervals. After two years of ongoing treatment, we were able to observe that the deformities in hip, knee and foot were progressive in all SMA Type II patients, and in some Type III. Muscle strength stabilized in most SMA Type III patients, and improved in some. MMT was not done in SMA Type II. In all patients we were able to detect an improvement in the Barthel Ladder scale. This study suggests that a measurable improvement in the quality of daily living may be obtained in patients with SMA Types II and III subjected to conventional physiotherapy when associated with hydrotherapy."

Frequently, however, the end result of published research lacks the detail of the collaborative and integrative experimental design process, and the underlying conceptual framework. We review the recent progress in systems modelling and omics analysis of the heterocellular heart environment through complementary forward and inverse approaches, illustrating these conceptual and experimental frameworks with case studies from our own research program. The forward approach begins by collecting curated information from the niche cardiac biology literature, and connecting the dots to form mechanistic network models that generate testable system-level predictions. The inverse approach starts from the vast pool of public omics data in recent cardiac biological research, and applies bioinformatics analysis to produce novel candidates for further investigation. We also discuss the possibility of combining these two approaches into a hybrid framework, together with the benefits and challenges. These interdisciplinary research frameworks illustrate the interplay between computational models, omics analysis, and wet lab experiments, which holds the key to making real progress in improving human cardiac wellbeing.

Developing neutralizing mAb to disrupt the ternary complex and abrogate the resulting toxicity is a major therapeutic challenge because SEB is effective at very low concentrations. We show that combining two SEB-specific mAbs enhances their efficacy, even though one of the two mAbs by itself has no effect on neutralization. Crystallography was employed for fine-mapping conformational epitopes in binary and ternary complexes between SEB and Fab fragments. NMR spectroscopy was used to validate and identify subtle allosteric changes induced by mAbs binding to SEB. The mapping of epitopes established that a combination of different mAbs can enhance efficacy of mAb-mediated protection from SEB induced lethal shock by two different mechanisms: one mAb mixture promoted clearance of the toxin both in vitro and in vivo by FcR-mediated cross-linking and clearance, whereas the other mAb mixture induced subtle allosteric conformational changes in SEB that perturbed formation of the SEB·T-cell receptor·major histocompatibility complex class II trimer. Finally structural information accurately predicted mAb binding to other superantigens that share conformational epitopes with SEB. Fine mapping of conformational epitopes is a powerful tool to establish the mechanism and optimize the action of synergistic mAb combinations. "

These findings potentially reflect left-handers' advantage over their right-handed competitors in those sports. Although considered crucial for successful performance, the tactical component of their superiority has yet to be analysed. Two studies were conducted to test for a side bias in tennis players' tactical preferences. In the first study, 108 right- and left-handed players of varying skill watched rallies on a computer screen and had to indicate where they would place the ball in the opposing half. The results showed the tactical preference of players to place more balls on a left-handed opponent's mostly stronger forehand side compared with when faced with a right-hander. In the second study, 54 professional tennis matches involving right- and left-handers were analysed with respect to ball placement frequencies on the opponent's backhand side. Significantly fewer balls were hit to the backhand side of a left-handed opponent, thus replicating the findings of Study 1 in on-court situations. Both studies indicate players' preference to place shots to their right irrespective of their opponent's handedness. Findings support the assumption that left-handers might enjoy a strategic advantage in tennis."

Interfaces for the connection of various functional parts play a major role in the performance of a system. Here, we developed a rapid prototyping method to fabricate monolithic poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) interfaces for flow-gated injection, online reagent mixing, and tube-to-tube connection in an integrated capillary electrophoresis (CE) system. The basic idea was based on the properties of PDMS: elasticity, transparency, and suitability for prototyping. The molds for these interfaces were prepared by using commercially available stainless steel wires and nylon lines or silica capillaries. A steel wire was inserted through the diameter of a nylon line and a cross format was obtained as the mold for PDMS casting of flow gates and 4-way mixers. These interfaces accommodated tubing connection through PDMS elasticity and provided easy visual trouble shooting. The flow gate used smaller channel diameters, thus reducing flow rate by 25-fold for effective gating compared with mechanically machined counterparts. Both PDMS mixers and the tube-to-tube connectors could minimize the sample dead volume by using an appropriate capillary configuration. As a whole, the prototyped PDMS interfaces are reusable, inexpensive, convenient for connection, and robust when integrated with the CE detection system. Therefore, these interfaces could see potential applications in CE and CE-coupled systems. "

Whereas insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) stimulates PI3-kinase-dependent activation of Akt, expression of a kinase-inactive Akt did not alter IGF-I-stimulated proliferation. In other cell types, Akt-dependent phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3 beta) inhibits its activity and its ability to stimulate apoptosis. The aim of the present study was to determine whether endogenous IGF-I regulates Akt-dependent GSK-3 beta phosphorylation and activity and whether it regulates apoptosis in human intestinal muscle cells. IGF-I elicited time- and concentration-dependent GSK-3 beta phosphorylation (inactivation) that was measured by Western blot analysis using a phospho-specific GSK-3beta antibody. Endogenous IGF-I stimulated GSK-3 beta phosphorylation and inhibited GSK-3 beta activity (measured by in vitro kinase assay) in these cells. IGF-I-dependent GSK-3 beta phosphorylation and the resulting GSK-3 beta inactivation were mediated by activation of a PI3-kinase-dependent, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1)-dependent, and Akt-dependent mechanism. Deprivation of serum induced beta-catenin phosphorylation, increased in caspase 3 activity, and induced apoptosis of muscle cells, which was inhibited by either IGF-I or a GSK-3 beta inhibitor. Endogenous IGF-I inhibited beta-catenin phosphorylation, caspase 3 activation, and apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. IGF-I-dependent inhibition of apoptosis, similar to GSK-3 beta activity, was mediated by a PI3-kinase-, PDK-1-, and Akt-dependent mechanism. We conclude that endogenous IGF-I exerts two distinct but complementary effects on intestinal smooth muscle cell growth: it stimulates proliferation and inhibits apoptosis. The growth of intestinal smooth muscle cells is regulated jointly by the net effect of these two processes."

In the case of binary data, such as yes/no responses, or such as the presence/absence of a symptom or a behavior, theories often actually predict that certain response probabilities change monotonically in a specific direction and/or that certain response probabilities are bounded from above or below in specific ways. A regression analysis is not really true to such a theory in that it may leave out parsimonious constraints and in that extraneous assumptions like linearity or log-linearity, or even the assumption of a functional relationship, are dictated by the method rather than the theory. That mismatch may well bias the results of empirical analysis and jeopardize attempts at meaningful replication of psychological research. This tutorial shows how contemporary order-constrained methods can shed more light on such questions, using far weaker auxiliary assumptions, while also formulating more detailed, nuanced, and concise hypotheses, and allowing for quantitative model selection.

The studies were performed in vitro by incubating Tc-99m (V) DMSA with blood (one sample at 4 degrees Celcius and another at 37 degrees Celcius) to assess its binding to plasma proteins using ultrafiltration, dialysis, electrophoresis, gel filtration chromatography and affinity chromatography. A parallel experiment for determining the blood binding of Ga-67 citrate was performed using the same procedures. Using ultrafiltration, dialysis, electrophoresis and gel filtration chromatography, labeled plasma samples showed that protein binding for Tc-99m (V) DMSA was 45-54% at 37 degrees Celcius and 73-80% at 4 degrees Celcius. The figures for Ga-67 citrate were 43-53% at 37 degrees Celcius and 75-81% at 4 degrees Celcius. Electrophoresis showed that Tc-99m (V) DMSA was mostly bound to plasma albumin (36.05 +/- 2.48% at 37 degrees Celcius and 60.04 +/- 1.87% at 4 degrees Celcius), and that the proportion of Ga-67 radioactivity associated with beta-globulin was 34.23 +/- 1.37% at 37 degrees Celcius and 55.71 +/- 3.69% at 4 degrees Celcius. In affinity chromatography experiments, Tc-99m (V) DMSA did not bind to transferrin, unlike Ga-67 citrate. This study demonstrates that, at the radiopharmaceutical tracer level, most Tc-99m (V) DMSA in blood is protein-bound, primarily to albumin, but not to transferrin. In contrast, Ga-67 citrate was bound primarily to transferrin. The knowledge that albumin is the main transport protein of Tc-99m (V) DMSA may contribute to a better understanding of its biodistribution and pharmacokinetics."

CD012599,First and second trimester serum tests with and without first trimester ultrasound tests for Down's syndrome screening," The aim of this review was to estimate and compare the accuracy of first and second trimester serum markers with and without first trimester ultrasound markers for the detection of Down’s syndrome in the antenatal period, as combinations of markers. Individual markers are described in the other reviews belonging to this suite. Accuracy is described by the proportion of fetuses with Down’s syndrome detected by screening before birth (sensitivity or detection rate) and the proportion of women with a low risk (normal) screening test result who subsequently had a baby unaffected by Down's syndrome (specificity).",9128217,0,Coexistence of aldosteronoma and contralateral nonfunctioning adrenal adenoma in primary aldosteronism.,"A case of primary aldosteronism is presented in which computed tomography showed bilateral adrenal tumors. Adrenal scintigraphy during dexamethasone suppression revealed bilateral radiotracer uptake, with markedly predominant visualization of the left side. The left adrenal gland was removed, and an aldosterone-producing adenoma was confirmed by histologic examination. Fifteen months after surgery, serum potassium and plasma aldosterone were normal, and a marked decrease of blood pressure was observed, indicating that the right adrenal tumor was a benign nonfunctioning mass. Unilateral adrenalectomy on the side of the scintigraphically predominant lesion reversed the clinical syndrome of primary aldosteronism."

To this aim, we combined in vivo brain microdialysis, biotelemetry and metabolic measurements for continuous monitoring of core body temperature (T(core)), neurotransmitters and thermoregulatory responses. The animals were exercised for 1h at 23°C. Treadmill speed was increased every 20 min (10, 20 and 26 m min⁻¹). T(core), oxygen consumption (V˙O₂, an index of heat production) and tail skin temperature (T(tail), an index of heat loss) were simultaneously measured. Brain microdialysis samples were collected every 10 min, and these samples were analyzed for noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT). T(core) and V˙O(2)₂ significantly increased during treadmill and were exercise intensity dependent. After an initial drop T(tail) increased significantly during exercise. Both NA and DA levels in the PO/AH increased significantly during exercise. There was no effect on serotonin release. T(core), V˙O₂ and T(tail) were positively correlated with the levels of NA and DA. Our data suggest that thermoregulatory responses are dependent on the intensity of the exercise and that these responses are associated with changes in NA and DA release, but not in 5-HT release in the PO/AH."

A genetically encoded bioluminescent probe for stress sensing was first synthesized with a LXXLL motif-linked ligand binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR LBD), which was then sandwiched between the fragments of Gaussia luciferase (GLuc). This prototype of the bioluminescent indicators was carefully modified with a circular permutation (CP) and/or a corepressor motif. The first notable appearance by cofusion of a corepressor motif to the probe was the biphasic dose-response curves of the indicator to cortisol. A CP largely improved the detection limit of the indicator to cortisol up to 100 times. Fabrication of both CP and the attachment of a corepressor motif in the indicator synergistically contributes to (i) the lower detection limit and wider dynamic range and (ii) the enhanced absolute luminescence and ligand selectivity. This study is the first example that contribution of corepressor motifs to single-chain probes was investigated. This study also provides new insight into improving the sensorial properties of single-chain probes with CP."

The commonly carried out exercise tests cause psychic stress, thereby intensifying these arrhythmias and giving rise to diagnostic errors. For this reason seven children 4--14 years old were additionally examined under various sports comparable to those work loads. It could be demonstrated that these telemetrically listed ECG traces showed definitely fewer premature beats than those listed under laboratory conditions. This method enables more exact evaluation of arrhythmias by exclusion of psychic stress and helps to beware children from unnecessary restriction of way of life."

Sarcocysts were excised and morphologically classified by light microscopy, and some cysts were further examined by scanning electron microscopy or DNA amplification and sequencing at the small subunit (ssu) rRNA gene. In Norwegian moose, three sarcocyst types were recognized, yet five Sarcocystis species were found by sequence analysis. New names were proposed for three species which could be characterised by both morphological and molecular methods, i.e., Sarcocystis alces, Sarcocystis ovalis, and Sarcocystis scandinavica. S. alces was the most prevalent species, whereas S. scandinavica and the two unnamed species were rare and might either use another principal intermediate host or a rare definitive host. The five species in Norwegian moose were different from Sarcocystis alceslatrans isolated from a Canadian moose. Phylogenetic analyses based on complete ssu rRNA gene sequences revealed a close relationship between the six Sarcocystis species from moose and species from reindeer and Sika deer. We conclude that molecular methods are necessary for unequivocal species identification, as different cervid hosts harbour morphologically indistinguishable sarcocysts."

In the PTZ-model, altered heat shock protein 27 (HSP-27) expression highlights seizure-affected astrocytes, which play an important role in glutamate and GABA metabolism. This raises the question whether impaired neurotransmitter metabolism leads to an imbalance in neurotransmitter receptor expression. Consequently, we investigated the effects of seizures on the densities of seven different neurotransmitter receptors in rats which were repeatedly treated with PTZ (40 mg/kg) over a period of 14 days. Quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography was used to measure the regional binding site densities of the glutamate alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), kainate and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, the adenosine receptor type 1 (A(1)), which is part of the system controlling glutamate release, and the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors GABA(A) and GABA(B) as well as the GABA(A)-associated benzodiazepine (BZ) binding sites in each rat. Our results demonstrate altered receptor densities in brain regions of PTZ-treated animals, including the HSP-27 expressing foci (i.e. amygdala, piriform and entorhinal cortex, dentate gyrus). A general decrease of kainate receptor densities was observed together with an increase of NMDA binding sites in the hippocampus, the somatosensory, piriform and the entorhinal cortices. Furthermore, A(1) binding sites were decreased in the amygdala and hippocampal CA1 region (CA1), while BZ binding sites were increased in the dentate gyrus and CA1. Our data demonstrate the impact of PTZ induced seizures on the densities of kainate, NMDA, A(1) and BZ binding sites in epileptic brain. These changes are not restricted to regions showing glial impairment. Thus, an altered balance between different excitatory (NMDA) and modulatory receptors (A(1), BZ binding sites, kainate) shows a much wider regional distribution than that of glial HSP-27 expression, indicating that receptor changes are not following the glial stress responses, but may precede the HSP-27 expression."
CD009593,Xpert® MTB/RIF assay for pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults,"Since Xpert MTB/RIF can detect both TB and rifampicin resistance, we had two review questions with the following primary objectives: Xpert MTB/RIF for TB detection To determine summary estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF for the diagnosis of pulmonary TB in adults Xpert MTB/RIF for rifampicin resistance detection To determine summary estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF for detection of rifampicin resistance in adults",15520866,0,Recruitment and expansion of dendritic cells in vivo potentiate the immunogenicity of plasmid DNA vaccines.,"DCs are critical for priming adaptive immune responses to foreign antigens. However, the utility of harnessing these cells in vivo to optimize the immunogenicity of vaccines has not been fully explored. Here we investigate a novel vaccine approach that involves delivering synergistic signals that both recruit and expand DC populations at the site of antigen production. Intramuscular injection of an unadjuvanted HIV-1 envelope (env) DNA vaccine recruited few DCs to the injection site and elicited low-frequency, env-specific immune responses in mice. Coadministration of plasmids encoding the chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha) and the DC-specific growth factor fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand with the DNA vaccine resulted in the recruitment, expansion, and activation of large numbers of DCs at the site of inoculation. Consistent with these findings, coadministration of these plasmid cytokines also markedly augmented DNA vaccine---elicited cellular and humoral immune responses and increased protective efficacy against challenge with recombinant vaccinia virus. These data suggest that the availability of mature DCs at the site of inoculation is a critical rate-limiting factor for DNA vaccine immunogenicity. Synergistic recruitment and expansion of DCs in vivo may prove a practical strategy for overcoming this limitation and potentiating immune responses to vaccines as well as other immunotherapeutic strategies."

Unidimensional measurement of tumor size according to the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) is of utmost importance. The established RECIST definitions of changes in size are decisive for subdivision into the categories complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD), which are generally accepted as the concise characterization for therapy response. Problems with size-dependent response assessment occur particularly in targeted therapy and by phenomena, such as pseudoprogression. Several variants of functional imaging and their role in cancer imaging regarding practical requests are introduced. "

Kinetics following rapid changes of the local paH at sub-zero temperatures.,"The kinetics of the spin transition in the heme iron of the cytochrome P-450 substrate complex have been observed by stopped-flow measurements between 4 degrees C and -27 degrees C. Large displacements in the spin equilibrium are induced by small changes in the concentration of hydrogen or potassium ions. The kinetic and thermodynamic data indicate that the spin transition is rate-limited by conformational changes of the protein. The spin transition appears to be governed by the local paH, modulated in turn by external factors: a satisfying kinetic analysis is attained only by accounting for the difference between local paH (paH, in) and bulk paH (paH, out), as described in the preceding paper. Indeed, the low-spin to high-spin rate constant obeys a local paH titration curve with a pK = 5.4 +/- 0.1 at -17 degrees C."

Six of 12 Mab2s possessed potential internal image characteristics by recognizing a common idiotype on murine and swine anti-GP5 antibodies. Further serological characterization demonstrated that one of the Mab2 (Mab2-5G2) represents internal image anti-idiotope which mimicked the GP5 antigen that inhibited the interaction between idiotypic anti-GP5 antibodies and GP5 antigen, its reaction with the idiotypic anti-GP5 antibody was inhibited by GP5 antigen and detected the common Id on anti-PRRSV antibodies from pigs that were experimentally infected with PRRSV. In addition, Mab2-5G2 identified a soluble protein on MA-104 and porcine alveolar macrophages. These results indicate that Mab2-5G2 may be a useful candidate as an alternative PRRSV serodiagnostic reagent and a useful probe to study PRRSV-cell interaction."

Twelve athletes were evaluated at the beginning (week 0, T1), in the middle (week 6, T2), and at the end (week 12, T3) of the soccer training program. On the first day at 7:30 am, before collecting the blood sample at rest for the determination of the hematological parameters, the athletes were conducted to the anthropometric evaluation. On the second day at 8:30 am, the athletes had their anaerobic threshold measured. Analysis of variance with Newman-Keuls'post hoc was used for statistical comparisons between the parameters measured during the soccer training program. Correlations between the parameters analyzed were determined using the Pearson's correlation coefficient. Erythrocytes concentration, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were significantly increased from T1 to T2. The specific soccer training program led to a rise in erythrocytes, hemoglobin, and hematocrit from T1 to T2. We assumed that these results occurred due to the plasma volume reduction and may be explained by the soccer training program characteristics. Furthermore, we did not observe any correlation between the anaerobic threshold and the hematological parameters."

We assessed effectiveness in terms of: Increase in the proportion of participants who received prophylaxis (RP) Increase in the proportion of participants who received appropriate prophylaxis (RAP) Decrease in the proportion of participants who developed any VTE (i.e. all, symptomatic, asymptomatic VTE; proximal, distal, or any DVT; PE, or fatal PE) Decrease in the proportion of participants who developed symptomatic VTE (i.e. all VTE; proximal, distal, or any DVT; PE, or fatal PE) Decrease in the proportion of participants who develop asymptomatic VTE (detected by systematic screening of participants who did not have symptoms of DVT or PE) Decrease in the number of deaths (all‐cause mortality, sudden death) Safety of the intervention (e.g. frequency of bleeding or other complications)",11446,0,Effect of oxygen saturation on H+ and Cl- distribution across the red cell membrane in human and ruminant blood.,"Alterations of red cell pH (pHc) and distribution ratios of H+ (gammaH+) and Cl (gammaCl-) between plasma and red blood cells with oxygenation of blood were studied in human blood (audult and fetal) and ruminant blood (bovine, goat and sheep). The experiments were carried out at a plasma pH of 7.0 to 7.7 and at 37 degrees C. In human blood pHc of fully oxygenated blood was 0.035 pH lower than that of fully deoxygenated blood in all ranges of plasma pH studied. In ruminant blood, however, the differences in pHc between oxygenated and deoxygenated blood were 0.011 in ox, and 0.003 in goat and sheep, all of them not being significant. The decreases in gammaH+ accompanying oxygenation were in fairly good agreement with those in gammaCl- in human blood and amounted to about 0.05. In ruminant blood, in spite of virtually zero changes in gammaH+ with oxygenation, the decreases in gammaCl- were slightly greater than those in human blood. There might be a species difference in the mechanisms of distribution of Cl- and H+ across the red cell membrane."
CD009925,Second trimester serum tests for Down's Syndrome screening,"The aim of this review was to estimate and compare the accuracy of second trimester serum markers for the detection of Down’s syndrome in the antenatal period, both as individual markers and as combinations of markers. Accuracy is described by the proportion of fetuses with Down’s syndrome detected by screening before birth (sensitivity or detection rate) and the proportion of women with a low risk (normal) screening test result who subsequently had a baby unaffected by Down's syndrome (specificity). We grouped our analyses to focus on investigating the value of adding increasing numbers of markers (comparing single, dual, triple and quadruple tests), and of including Inhibin A, the most recent routine addition to serum marker combinations. Investigation of sources of heterogeneity We investigated whether a uniform screening test is suitable for all women, or whether different screening methods are more applicable to different groups, defined by advanced maternal age, ethnic groups and aspects of the pregnancy and medical history such as multiple pregnancy, diabetes and family history of Down's syndrome. We also considered whether there existed evidence of overestimation of test accuracy in studies evaluating risk equations in the derivation sample rather than in a separate validation sample.",9137473,0,HBO and the uptake and retention of [125I] MIBG in human platelets and two neuroendocrine cell lines.,"In this paper we report the effects of Hyperbaric Oxygen (HBO) exposure on the uptake and retention of meta-Iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) in human platelets and two neuroendocrine cell lines. The combination of [131I] MIBG and HBO is used for therapy of neuroblastoma. Exposure to HBO can cause oxidative stress, which is potentially capable of affecting uptake and storage of MIBG in both neuroendocrine cells and platelets. Oxidative stress generated by menadione decreased both the uptake and retention of MIBG in the platelets and the cell lines. HBO did not affect these processes, indicating that the HBO induced oxidative stress is not high enough to affect the MIBG uptake and storage pathways in these cells. This suggests that the positive effects observed by the treatment of neuroblastoma patients with the combination of HBO and [131I] MIBG are most likely not due to improved uptake or retention of MIBG in the neuroblastoma. Neither can reduced cytotoxicity (trombocytopenia) be expected due to decreased uptake/retention of [131I] MIBG in platelets or their precursor cells."

Activation of so-called orphan nuclear receptors has been identified to result in increased expression of these detoxifying systems and consequently altered drug levels in the human body. In order to anticipate such mechanisms already in early stages of drug design and to avoid dangerous drug-drug interactions, reliable in silico simulation tools are highly desirable. This review aims to give an introduction into induction of drug metabolism and transport and focuses on computer-assisted molecular modeling prediction techniques, on their applicability and limitations, on recent case studies, and on success stories."

The underlying pathogenetic mechanismswere probed by studying the reserves and clonogenic potential of BM megakaryocytic progenitor cells using flow-cytometry and a collagen-based clonogenic assay for the identification of megakaryocyte colony-forming units (CFU-Meg). Thrombopoietin (TPO) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFbeta1) levels were also evaluated in long-term BM culture supernatants using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. CIN patients (n = 39) showed a low proportion of BM CD34(+)/CD61(+) megakaryocytic progenitor cells and low frequency of early and mixed CFU-Meg in the BM mononuclear, but not CD34(+), cell fraction, compared with healthy controls (n = 20). TPO and TGFbeta1 levels were significantly higher in patients compared with controls. TPO levels inversely correlated with platelet counts whereas TGFbeta1 values correlated inversely with CD34(+)/CD61(+) and CFU-Meg megakaryocytic progenitor cell numbers and positively with TPO levels. The addition of an anti-TGFbeta1 neutralising antibody significantly increased the numbers of CFU-Meg in CIN patients but not in controls, compared with baseline. These data suggest that increased local production of TGFbeta1 probably affects the BM megakaryocytic progenitor cell growth in CIN whereas the compensatory production of TPO finally balances the TGFbeta1-induced inhibitory effect."

The results indicated that out 102 lung specimens observed in the dissection room 37.26% appeared to have fissural or lobation anomalies and 63% of the anomalies were described in the right lung. Fissural anomalies accounted for 28.44% while the lobation anomalies were observed in 8.82% of the specimens. The abnormal fissure that were observed included the left minor fissure 10.78%, incomplete horizontal fissure 7.84%, diaphragmatic fissure 7.84%, right minor fissure 0.98% and azygos fissure 0.98%. Further observation revealed that 5.88% of the right lungs appeared to have two lobes and 2.94% of the left lungs had three lobes. The current study indicates that the right lung is commonly affected with fissural and lobation anomalies and that the left minor fissure is the commonly occurring fissural anomaly. Documentation and familiarization of these anomalies remain to be important for making correct radiological diagnosis and also for proper surgical management of lung pathology."

The pH optima were 4.0 and 4.5, and the KM values for p-nitrophenyl phosphate hydrolysis were 1.8 mM and 6.5 mM for enzymes I and II respectively. The specific specific activity in units (0.01 mumol/min) per mg protein was 4.80 +/- 0.85 and 0.54 +/- 0.07 for enzymes I and  II respectively. The specific activity from uninfected muscles was only 0.39 (SD +/- 0.017) units per mg of protein. Both enzymes were inhibited by NaF, HgCl2, and cysteine but were stimulated by 2-mercaptoethanol. EDTA and iodoacetamide had no effect on enzyme I but enzyme II was activated by EDTA and inhibited by iodoacetamide. Cadmium ions inhibited both the enzymes but a conspicuous feature with enzyme II was in the increase in percentage inhibition by lowering the concentration of CD2+."

Both overlapping distribution and cavity insertion Widom methods are complementarily used. The former is useful for a dense region where water molecules are found, i.e., from the interfacial to bulk water region, while the latter works well in the low density region, i.e., the hydrocarbon region. Since both methods evaluate the excess chemical potential of water, the obtained FE profile is free from the fitting problem usually arisen when a FE difference method is used. A diphytanyl phosphatidylcholine bilayer is used for our test calculations. An excellent and fast convergence of the chemical potential is obtained when each method is applied for the appropriate region. The estimated FE barrier using the Ewald method for the electrostatic interaction is approximately 7.2 kcal/mol, which is higher than that using the interaction cutoff of 20 A by about 0.9 kcal/mol."

Among the various amino acids in proteins, tryptophan residues are especially susceptible to attack by reactive nitrogen species. We carried out experiments on the reactions of peroxynitrite and other reactive nitrogen species with N-acetyl-L-tryptophan under various conditions. Four major products were identified as 1-nitroso-N-acetyl-L-tryptophan, 1-nitro-N-acetyl-L-tryptophan, 6-nitro-N-acetyl-L-tryptophan, and N-acetyl-N'-formyl-L-kynurenine on the basis of their mass and UV spectra. The reactions with SIN-1 (a peroxynitrite generator), Angeli's salt (a nitroxyl donor), and spermine NONOate (a nitric oxide donor) generated the nitroso derivative but not the nitro derivatives. A myeloperoxidase-H(2)O(2)-NO(2)(-) system generated the nitro derivatives but not the nitroso derivative. Under physiological conditions 6-nitro-N-acetyl-L-tryptophan was stable, whereas the 1-nitroso and 1-nitro derivatives decomposed with half-lives of 1.5 and 18 h, respectively. After treatment with various reactive nitrogen species, bovine serum albumin was enzymatically hydrolyzed and analyzed for 6-nitro-L-tryptophan and 3-nitro-L-tyrosine by HPLC with electrochemical detection. Levels of 6-nitro-L-tryptophan and 3-nitro-L-tyrosine were similar in the nitrated protein. 6-Nitro-L-tryptophan in proteins can be measured as an additional biomarker of protein nitration."

Trinitrophenyl-bovine serum albumin (TNP24BSA) and dinitrophenyl-bonvine serum albumin (DNP23BSA) and sulfanil-BSA (Sulf17-BSA) in different dilutions were used as inhibitors. BALB/c spleen contained by 60% more TNP-RFC than C576/6 spleen. F1 hybrids (F1 X BALB/c) contained on the average by 35% more TNP-RFC than (F1 X C57BL/6). Inhibition curves (avidity curves) were essentially different in the two mouse lines and F1 hybrids. A conclusion was drawn that the TNP-REC content and avidity were under a strong genetic control. Together with the assumption of random expression of V-genes (idiotype genes?) in the lymphocytes the above data suggest that the simplest mechanism of the genetic control could be a definitive ratio between the corresponding groups of V-genes."

Unfortunately, efforts to reduce GVHD by removing donor T cells have resulted in poor engraftment and elevated disease recurrence. Alternative cell populations capable of supporting allogeneic hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell engraftment without inducing GVHD could increase numbers of potential recipients while broadening the pool of acceptable donors. Although unfractionated CD4(+) T cells have not been shown to be an efficient facilitating population, CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory cells (T-reg's) were examined for their capacity to support allogeneic hematopoietic engraftment. In a murine fully major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched BMT model, cotransplantation of donor B6 T-reg's into sublethally conditioned BALB/c recipients supported significantly greater lineage-committed and multipotential donor progenitors in recipient spleens 1 week after transplantation and significantly increased long-term multilineage donor chimerism. Donor engraftment occurred without GVHD-related weight loss or lethality and was associated with tolerance to donor and host antigens by in vitro and in vivo analyses. Donor CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells may therefore represent a potential alternative to unfractionated T cells for promotion of allogeneic engraftment in clinical hematopoietic cell transplantation."

The Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex of the photosynthetic green sulfur bacteria Chlorobium tepidum is a prototype efficient light-harvesting antenna: it stores the captured photon energy in the form of excitons (collective excitations), which are subsequently converted to chemical energy with almost 100% efficiency. These excitons show an elaborate relaxation pattern involving coherent and incoherent pathways. We make use of the complex chirality and fundamental symmetries of multidimensional optical signals to design new sequences of ultrashort laser pulses that can distinguish between coherent quantum oscillations and incoherent energy dissipation during the exciton relaxation. The cooperative dynamical features, which reflect the coherent nature of excitations, are amplified. The extent of quantum oscillations and their timescales in photosynthesis can be readily extracted from the designed signals, showing that cooperativity is maintained during energy transport in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex. The proposed pulse sequences may also be applied to reveal information on the robustness of quantum states in the presence of fluctuating environments in other nanoscopic complexes and devices."

Our previous work has suggested that progesterone initiates the human sperm acrosome reaction, at least in part, by activating a unique steroid receptor/Cl- channel resembling a gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor/Cl- channel (gamma-aminobutyric acidA-like receptor/Cl- channel). Here, the fluorescent intracellular Cl- probe, 6-methoxy-N-ethylquinolinium, was used to detect qualitative changes in sperm cytosolic Cl-. We demonstrate that progesterone can mediate a rapid transient decrease of human sperm cytosolic Cl- inhibitable by the gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor/Cl- channel antagonists picrotoxin and (+)-bicuculline (which also inhibit the acrosome reaction). These results support the involvement of a gamma-aminobutyric acidA-like receptor/Cl- channel in the P-mediated human acrosome reaction and are the first to demonstrate that a rapid Cl- efflux plays a role in that event."

The plasma Lp(a) levels were highly skewed towards low levels in this population, with a median of 84 mg/L and a mean of 166 mg/L. Approximately 20% had plasma Lp(a) above the threshold value of 300 mg/L, while 52% had Lp(a) levels below 100 mg/L. The most commonly occurring phenotype was apolipoprotien(a) S4. In this phenotype, Lp(a) concentrations ranged from not detectable to 468 mg/L. There was a positive relationship between cigarette smoking and plasma Lp(a) concentration in men. Apolipoprotein A1 and bilirubin were positively associated with Lp(a) in the 40-60 age group and a positive relationship between weight and Lp(a) concentrations was observed in those aged 60 years or over. Thus, although Lp(a) is mainly genetically determined, there are clearly other factors which contribute to variations in Lp(a) concentrations. "

These mutations give rise to mutant p63alpha protein isoforms with dominant effects towards their wild-type counterparts. Here we report four RHS/AEC-like patients with mutations (p.Gln9fsX23, p.Gln11X, p.Gln16X), that introduce premature termination codons in the N-terminal part of the p63 protein. These mutations appear to be incompatible with the current paradigms of dominant-negative/gain-of-function outcomes for other p63 mutations. Moreover it is difficult to envisage how the remaining small N-terminal polypeptide contributes to a dominant disease mechanism. Primary keratinocytes from a patient containing the p.Gln11X mutation revealed a normal and aberrant p63-related protein that was just slightly smaller than the wild-type p63. We show that the smaller p63 protein is produced by translation re-initiation at the next downstream methionine, causing truncation of a non-canonical transactivation domain in the DeltaN-specific isoforms. Interestingly, this new DeltaDeltaNp63 isoform is also present in the wild-type keratinocytes albeit in small amounts compared with the p.Gln11X patient. These data establish that the p.Gln11X-mutation does not represent a null-allele leading to haploinsufficiency, but instead gives rise to a truncated DeltaNp63 protein with dominant effects. Given the nature of other RHS/AEC-like syndrome mutations, we conclude that these mutations affect only the DeltaNp63alpha isoform and that this disruption is fundamental to explaining the clinical characteristics of these particular ectodermal dysplasia syndromes."

However, the analysis contains a fundamental error: use of rates of molecular evolution inferred from uncorrected sequence divergence to put a time frame on a tree with branch lengths greatly elongated by complex likelihood and rate-smoothing models. Furthermore, this date implies that basal splits within agamids occurred implausibly early, at least 300 MYA (100 Myr before the first fossil lizards and coincident with the earliest fossil reptiles). Analyses of the mtDNA data using more appropriate methods and new information from nuclear (c-mos) sequences suggest a much more recent divergence between SE Asian and Australian agamids (around 30 MYA). Using two fossil boundary dates, bootstrapping the c-mos data gives a 95% confidence interval for this divergence time that is sufficiently recent (14-41 MYA) to exclude an ancient Gondwanan vicariance and is more consistent with Miocene over-water dispersal. As with the mtDNA, the c-mos data implies implausibly old basal divergences among agamids if a Gondwanan age is assumed for the Australasian clade. The analyses also highlight how methods for creating ultrametric trees (especially nonparametric rate smoothing) can greatly modify branch lengths and, thus, always require internal calibrations. The errors associated with inferred dates in the previous study (inferred through parametric bootstrapping) were also unjustifiably low, as this method only considers stochasticity in the substitution model and ignores much larger sources of uncertainty, such as variation in character sampling, tree topology, and calibration accuracy."

The ability of Hh proteins to exert their biological effects is regulated by a series of post-translational processes. These processes include an intramolecular cleavage, covalent addition of cholesterol and/or palmitate, and conversion into a multimeric freely diffusible form.

In our laboratory, we study the biochemistry and cell biology of systemic autoimmune disease autoantigens during different forms of cell death. Several different methods for inducing apoptosis, and for assaying the induction of this cellular process, are routinely performed.

The method is based on the immunization and subsequent challenge of transgenic (Tg) mice susceptible to poliovirus. We describe a similar method for the assessment of the protectiveness of serotype 1 IPV and demonstrate that experimental IPV produced from attenuated Sabin strain (sIPV) of serotype 1 poliovirus induced serum neutralizing antibodies, immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgM, and salivary IgA at titers comparable to those induced by conventional IPV (cIPV) produced from the wild-type Mahoney strain.

In particular, high levels of GnRH-R transcripts have been detected in rat and human ovarian granulosa cells. To better understand the role of the GnRH-R in the ovary under physiological conditions and to determine which follicles are potentially responsive to the actions of GnRH, we used in situ hybridization histochemistry and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for measurement of ovarian GnRH-R messenger RNA (mRNA) expression during the rat ovulatory cycle. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed that total ovarian GnRH-R mRNA levels were elevated significantly at 1800 h on proestrus and again at 0900 and 1800 h on estrus compared to metestrus 0900 h levels. In situ hybridization analysis of GnRH-R gene expression at different stages of follicular maturation revealed significant variation in GnRH-R mRNA levels with respect to the degree of follicular development as well as the estrous cycle stage. GnRH-R gene expression was greatest in the granulosa cells of Graafian and atretic follicles, with lower levels of expression present in preantral and small antral follicles and corpora lutea. GnRH-R mRNA levels in atretic follicles showed substantial variation across the 4-day rat estrous cycle, with mRNA levels increasing 3-fold on the day of proestrus coincident with the preovulatory gonadotropin surges. A second peak of expression in atretic follicles was observed on the morning of estrus. Levels of GnRH-R gene expression in corpora lutea also varied significantly during the estrous cycle, with gene expression increasing 3-fold between the morning of metestrus and the afternoon of proestrus. These results demonstrate that the level and localization of ovarian GnRH-R mRNAs change significantly during the rat ovulatory cycle. The finding that atretic follicles exhibit the greatest degree of GnRH-R gene expression is consistent with a role for GnRH in the induction of follicular atresia."

As a part of the DIOCM standard, WADO service defined how to access DICOM objects on the Web, but it didn't involve three-dimensional post-processing operations on the series images. This paper analyzed the technical features of three-dimensional post-processing operations on the volume data, and then designed and implemented a web service system for three-dimensional post-processing operations of medical images based on the WADO protocol. In order to improve the scalability of the proposed system, the business tasks and calculation operations were separated into two modules. As results, it was proved that the proposed system could support three-dimensional post-processing service of medical images for multiple clients at the same moment, which met the demand of accessing three-dimensional post-processing operations on the volume data on the web.

Individual markers are described in the other reviews belonging to this suite. Accuracy is described by the proportion of fetuses with Down’s syndrome detected by screening before birth (sensitivity or detection rate) and the proportion of women with a low risk (normal) screening test result who subsequently had a baby unaffected by Down's syndrome (specificity).",80888,0,[Detection of common antigenic determinants in the envelopes of mammalian type D (Mason--Pfizer) and type C virions by using the virion precipitation reaction].,"Immune sera to Mason-Pfizer virus (M-PMV) are capable of precipitating type C viruses of mice (NIH-MuLV, G-MuLV, and to a lower degree R-MuLV), cats  (FeLV, RD-114), and monkeys (SSV-1, GALV, BEV). The immune sera to RD-114, BEV, SSV-1 and GALV viruses can precipitate M-PMV virions. The adsorption analysis suggests that cross-reactions between M-PMV, RD-114, NIH-MuLV, and G-MuLV viruses depend on common virus-specific antigenic determinants in the envelopes of the virions. The relationship between M-PMV and type C viruses decreases in the series RD-114--NIG-MuLV--G-MuLV. Type C viruses of mammals have common envelope antigenic determinants lacking in M-PMV. No common antigenic determinants with M-PMV have been found in the envelope of virions of bovine leukemia virus, type B virus of mice (MMTV), or type C avian virus (Pr-RSV)."

They are induced to excise and replicate by certain phages, are efficiently encapsidated in SaPI-specific small particles composed of phage virion proteins and are transferred at very high frequencies. In this study, we have analysed three SaPI genes that are important for the phage-SaPI interaction, int (integrase) terS (phage terminase small subunit homologue) and pif (phage interference function). SaPI1 int is required for SaPI excision, replication and packaging in a donor strain, and is required for integration in a recipient. A SaPI1 int mutant, following phage induction, produces small SaPI-specific capsids which are filled with partial phage genomes. SaPIbov1 DNA is efficiently packaged into full-sized phage heads as well as into SaPI-specific small ones, whereas SaPI1 DNA is found almost exclusively in the small capsids. TerS, however, determines DNA packaging specificity but not the choice of large versus small capsids. This choice is influenced by SaPIbov1 gene 12, which prevents phage DNA packaging into small capsids, and which is also primarily responsible for interference by SaPIbov1 with phage reproduction."

Fusion protein GST-Cd2+-hMT-3 was expressed after isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction and addition of 0.1 mmol/L CdSO4 into the culture medium, and mainly existed in cellular soluble fraction as revealed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis. Recombinant MT was purified by two purification procedures: ""proteinase digestion after purification"" method, e. g. by elution of GST-Cd2+-hMT-3 from GST affinity chromatography first, then proteinase digestion and GST affinity chromatographic purification again subsequently; and ""proteinase digestion in situ"" method, e. g. digestion of GST-Cd2+-hMT-3 directly on the column while its binding to the GST affinity chromatographic resin and collection of Cd2+-MT directly from the flow through fraction after the digestion. It was confirmed that the later procedure exhibited more effective and more convenient by avoiding the conventional elution, dialysis and lyophilization processes and increasing the purity, recovery or yield of the final product. After further purification by a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column, finally 6-7 mg of Cd2+-hMT-3 was obtained from 3 L of flask culture with the recovery of about 1.8%. SDS-PAGE, amino acid composition and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) analysis showed that the relative molecular mass of Cd2+-hMT-3 is about 7 000, with a purity above 90%. Its amino acid composition is consistent with the expected value of natural hMT-3, particularly no aromatic amino acid and histidine, and the atomic ratio of 21: (7.5 +/- 0.1) for S: Cd, is also consistent with the theoretical value of 21: 7."

We analyze urban and rural burrowing owls' variation in risk perception along separate but consecutive days (Treatment 1) and risk perception within the same day (Treatment 2). Fear behaviour was measured as flight initiation distances (FIDs) and aggressiveness level when a pedestrian approached repeatedly to an owl individual. We predict that the attenuation in fear response along treatments should add support to the habituation hypothesis (decrease the response to a repeatedly stimulus after verifying that it is irrelevant) while consistency in behaviour might be indicative of a personality trait. We found that FID decreased for measurements made on both treatments in rural owls and also in urban owls for Treatment 2. These results are compatible with a habituation process. We found that aggressiveness remained invariable along treatments in both habitats suggesting that different mechanisms underlie these behavioural responses. Our results suggest that owls' risk perception to humans can be adjusted based on environmental risk perception and that individuals are able to recognize and learn when a stimuli stops being a threat.

The original Chudley-Lowry family consists of three affected males in two generations. Linkage analysis had localized the gene to a large interval, Xp21-Xq26 and an obligate carrier was demonstrated to have highly skewed X inactivation. The combination of the clinical phenotype, consistent with that of the patients with ATR-X syndrome, the skewed X-inactivation pattern in a carrier female, as well as the mapping interval including band Xq13.3, prompted us to consider the XNP/ATR-X gene being involved in this syndrome. Using RT-PCR analysis, we screened the entire XNP/ATR-X gene and found a mutation in exon 2 (c.109C > T) giving rise to a stop codon at position 37 (p.R37X). Western blot and immunocytochemical analyses using a specific monoclonal antibody directed against XNP/ATR-X showed the protein to be present in lymphoblastoid cells from one affected male, despite the premature stop codon. To explain these discordant results, we further analyzed the 5' region of the XNP/ATR-X gene and found three alternative transcripts, which differ in the presence or absence of exon 2, and the length of exon 1. Our data suggest that ChLS is allelic to the ATR-X syndrome with its less severe phenotype being due to the presence of some XNP/ATR-X protein."

RhTSH has the advantage to avoid both the clinical consequences of hypothyroidism, with a positive impact on quality of life and work productivity, and the risk of cancer growth due to the long-lasting endogenous thyrotropin stimulation. RhTSH is a heterodimeric glycoprotein produced by recombinant DNA technology that has the ability to stimulate thyroglobulin production and radioiodine uptake by thyroid cells. RhTSH is now widely used in the follow-up of thyroid cancer patients in order to improve sensitivity of thyroglobulin (Tg) measurement as well as in preparation of (131)I diagnostic whole-body scan. Although initially approved only for diagnostic purposes, rhTSH has been now approved both in Europe and in the United States for remnant ablation in low-risk patients. As far as residual or metastatic cancer treatment, rhTSH has been initially used on a compassionate need basis for elderly and frailer patients and for patients in whom the withdrawal of thyroid hormone was medically contraindicated. Nowadays, there is a trend for widening the use of rhTSH in therapy, in order to avoid hypothyroidism and the concern about the effect of prolonged endogenous thyroid-stimulating hormone stimulation on cancerous cells. Unfortunately, the studies which address the efficacy of rhTSH in cancer treatment are still scarce and the opportunity of its clinical application remains controversial. In addition, rhTSH has been shown to improve the accuracy of [(18)F]-2-fluoro-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography to detect non-functioning thyroid cancer. Although all studies agree on that rhTSH is much better tolerated from the clinical point of view than thyroid hormone withdrawal, there is some controversy about its comparative ability to raise Tg levels and concentrate radioiodine in cancerous thyroid cells. The aim of this paper is to review the performances of rhTSH as compared to hypothyroidism, considering Tg stimulation and diagnostic whole-body scan sensitivity during follow-up, and its effectiveness for normal remnant ablation and for therapy of metastatic disease."

A one-pot synthesis of its copper(I) complex upon reduction of copper(II) is achieved at room temperature. This complex, which has been characterized by X-ray crystallography, shows a linear N-Cu-N geometry with Cu-N bond lengths of 1.89 A. X-ray structure reveals weak Cu...O interactions between copper and one of the imide oxygen atoms of the ligand framework. Additional weak Cu...O interactions between copper and oxygen atoms of the ClO(4)(-) counteranion are detected that lead to a zigzag polymeric chain with alternate ClO(4)(-) and copper ions.

The present study examined the presence and the antibiotic resistance patterns of Enterococcus spp. isolated from the Babolrud River in Babol and coastal waters in Babolsar. Seventy samples of water were collected in various regions of the Babolrud and coastal waters. Isolated bacteria were identified to the species level using standard biochemical tests and PCR technique. In total, 70 Enterococcus spp. were isolated from the Babolrud River and coastal waters of Babolsar. Enterococcus faecalis (68.6%) and Enterococcus faecium (20%) were the most prevalent species. Resistance to chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, and tetracyclin was prevalent. The presence of resistant Enterococcus spp. in coastal waters may transmit resistant genes to other bacteria; therefore, swimming in such environments is not suitable. "

Secondary objectives To provide the tools to calculate EUS diagnostic accuracy measures based on pre-test information, such as gastric cancer T-stage and N-stage prevalence (Bayes nomograms). To assess whether EUS performs differently in different subgroups of patients identified by the following parameters: year of publication, country (Western versus Eastern), EUS technical features (radial versus linear array; ultrasound frequency (MHz)), definition of target condition (for N-stage: lymph node morphology versus size), gastric tumor site (any site versus cardia region only) and prevalence of target condition.",21670554,0,Circulatory and central nervous system responses to different types of mental stress.,"The purpose of the present study was to compare the physiological responses to different types of mental stress encountered in the workplace. Circulatory and central nervous system responses were examined in 8 healthy males by exposing them to 20-min of white noise (80 dB(A)) and 20-min of computer-based mental arithmetic tasks as models of vascular and cardiac stress, respectively. The results indicated that both cardiac and vascular stresses increased blood pressure and showed a cumulative effect as exposure period was extended. Heart rate and prefrontal oxygenated hemoglobin levels (measured by NIRS) increased in the face of cardiac stress but were not clearly altered by vascular stress and indicated that cardiac stress higher cardiac response and requires more oxygen supply to the brain. As the central nervous system responded, an event-related potential P300 component was elicited by an auditory oddball task presented before and after each stress. The P300 amplitude increased for both stresses. However, P300 latency increased in response to cardiac stress but decreased with vascular stress in the left prefrontal. Thus, the circulatory and central nervous system responses to cardiac stress and to vascular stress may have different underlying mechanisms, and measuring physiological indices appears to be an effective method by which to evaluate the influence of mental stress."

Earlier studies have demonstrated that these antibodies increase their intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence upon binding of carbohydrate antigens. Using the four immobilized monoclonal antibodies with low affinities (K(d)>10(-6)M), fast kinetics (k(off)>1s(-1)), and high reversibility gave opportunities for developing a continuous immunosensor without any need for regeneration. Since intrinsic fluorescence was used, no extrinsic labeling was necessary. Sensitivity was in the range of 1-5 microM for panose, and 10-15 microM for maltose and the loss of intensity was as low as 3.5% per hour during measurements. Calculations of DeltaH degrees and DeltaS degrees from the temperature dependence of K(d) indicated an enthalpic driven antigen-antibody binding event that is diminished upon antibody immobilization. We feel certain that weakly interacting antibodies can be used in future applications for continuous monitoring where there is a need to achieve instantaneous information on the concentration of an analyte."

On the basis of this experimental data obtained with a pair of ovarian carcinoma cell lines, one of which was not expressing the exsorptive transporter P-glycoprotein and one of which was an MDR1-transfected, P-glycoprotein expressing variant, the kinetics of cellular uptake of the radiolabel (3)H-talinolol were calculated and the inhibitory constants at P-gp were determined for different flavonoids. With respect to the inhibition of P-gp function, among others, naringenin and isoquercitrin were identified as inhibitors, yet estimation of the inhibitory constant was only possible for uptake values corrected for non-P-glycoprotein-mediated processes. It was assumed that an additional inside-directed transporting protein (Carrier B), which is inhibited by the presence of test compounds, uptake of radiolabel was simulated as a function of the concentration of test-compound, with exemplary parameters for the rate constant (k(B)) of the additional Carrier B and the inhibition constants (K(I)-values) for both transporting proteins. The obtained uncorrected experimental data, which showed either inhibition or enhancement of radiolabel uptake as a function of the inhibitor concentration, were appropriately explained by the respective model. The respective model included an exsorptive transporter as well as carrier-mediating facilitated diffusion. It is concluded that flavonoids, such as naringenin and isoquercitrin, inhibit an inside-directed process in addition to their inhibition of P-glycoprotein-mediated exsorption."

The narrow beam test examines the ability of a rat to cross a narrow, elevated beam of wood or other material. In order to determine the utility of the narrow beam test in the study of Parkinsonism, it was of interest to characterise the performance of animals at this task. Rats were placed at one end of a 105 cm long, elevated beam and both the time it took to begin crossing the beam, as well as the total time taken to cross the beam, were measured. The effects of training, time of day and 6-hydroxydopamine lesion on beam performance were examined. Rats reached maximal performance at the task within a single test session and time of day had no effect on beam performance. Parkinsonian rats demonstrated a four-fold increase in both the latency to initiate the task and the total time to cross the beam (p < 0.05)."

In the treatment of malignant and infectious diseases, APC are used to stimulate and expand Ag-specific T cells for adoptive transfer, or used directly in vivo to present Ag. The choice of APC to use depends on the particular application and on practical considerations, which include ease of production, availability, reproducibility and (for clinical use) established safety. The diversity of APC in use partly reflects the fact that no single technique of Ag presentation is ideal. For the clinician and laboratory worker alike the field can seem illogical and confusing. In this review we outline the functional requirements of APC for the induction of T cells, classify the APC in common use and describe their laboratory and clinical applications."

The analyses show that mutation hot spots vary by cancer and that base pair changes and predicted amino acid changes in the gene product vary by cancer and by codon. The analyses use relative frequencies and epidemiologic measures of effect (prevalence ratios) not applied previously to these data. The five cancers in the database with the largest sample sizes were breast (418), colorectal (398), liver (341), non-small cell lung (313), and ovarian cancers (251), for a total of 1,721 reports of p53 mutations. The five cancers varied considerably in the distribution of mutations over sites, with different hot spots in each cancer. At the six most frequently reported codon sites, we compared base pair and amino acid changes by type of cancer. The comparison of base pair changes indicated a predominance of particular base pair changes at a codon (for example, C-->T and G-->A changes at Codon 248) and their association with specific cancers (C-->T changes with colorectal cancer and G-->A changes with both colorectal and breast cancers at codon 248). Comparing predicted amino acid changes by codon and cancer was also intriguing, as in codons 175 and 273, where arginine to cysteine and arginine to histidine changes were frequent in breast, colorectal, and ovarian cancers. Variations in p53 mutational distributions by cancer may be explained by different exposures to carcinogens or by organ-specific clonal selection. Further research may be stimulated by this analysis."

This rate, known as the critical flicker fusion rate, has been studied for both spatially uniform lights, and spatio-temporal displays. These studies have included both stabilized and unstablized retinal images, and report the maximum observable rate as 50-90 Hz. A separate line of research has reported that fast eye movements known as saccades allow simple modulated LEDs to be observed at very high rates. Here we show that humans perceive visual flicker artifacts at rates over 500 Hz when a display includes high frequency spatial edges. This rate is many times higher than previously reported. As a result, modern display designs which use complex spatio-temporal coding need to update much faster than conventional TVs, which traditionally presented a simple sequence of natural images. "

The authors show that it is extremely difficult to cure patients with end stage disease by this procedure. Based on experience that, if performed early, BMT can bring about over 50% potential cures, it is postulated that marrow grafts should be performed much earlier than is done at present. From the results in 45 patients with severe aplastic anemia it is concluded that the majority do not have a defect at the pluripotent stem cell itself. There is disturbed maturation to functional end cells which can be corrected in most instances by ALG, infusion of allogeneic marrow and low dose androgens. BMT between HLA-identical siblings need not cause major problems, but it involves a considerable risk of fatal complications such as irreversible marrow rejection and GvH."

For this we perform Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the thermodynamics of such a system and compare our numerical results with predictions based on the analytical parameter-free Wertheim theory. We explore a wide range of the temperature-density-composition space that defines the three-dimensional phase diagram of the system. As a result, we delimit the region of thermodynamic stability of the fluid. We find that for a large region of the phase diagram the Wertheim theory is able to give a quantitative description of the system. For higher densities, our simulations show that the system is crystallizing into a BCC structure. Finally, we study the relaxation dynamics of the system by means of the density and temperature dependences of the diffusion coefficient. We show that there exists a density range where the system passes reversibly from a gel to a fluid upon both heating and cooling, encountering neither demixing nor phase separation. "

As a result, financial aid has become the norm among college enrollees. Aid now flows not only to traditional college students but also to part-time students, older students, and students who never graduated from high school. Today aid is available not only to low-income students but also to middle- and even high-income families, in the form of grants, subsidized loans, and tax credits. The increasing size and complexity of the nation's student aid system has generated questions about effectiveness, heightened confusion among students and parents, and raised concerns about how program rules may interact. In this article, Susan Dynarski and Judith Scott-Clayton review what is known, and just as important, what is not known, about how well various student aid programs work. The evidence, the authors write, clearly shows that lowering costs can improve college access and completion. But this general rule is not without exception. First, they note, the complexity of program eligibility and delivery appears to moderate the impact of aid on college enrollment and persistence after enrollment. Second, for students who have already decided to enroll, grants that tie financial aid to academic achievement appear to boost college outcomes such as persistence more than do grants with no strings attached. Third, compared with grant aid, relatively little rigorous research has been conducted on the effectiveness of student loans. The paucity of evidence on student loans is particularly problematic both because they represent a large share of student aid overall and because their low cost (relative to grant aid) makes them an attractive option for policy makers. Future research is likely to focus on several issues: the importance of program design and delivery, whether there are unanticipated interactions between programs, and to what extent program effects vary across different types of students. The results of this evidence will be critical, the authors say, as politicians look for ways to control spending."

However, the presence of N(pro) and E(rns) coding regions, which are unique to pestiviruses, provides clear evidence of a pestivirus. Nevertheless, the amino acid identity of Bungowannah virus N(pro) and BVDV-1 N(pro) (strain CP7) is only 51.5%. By using a BVDV-1 backbone, a novel chimeric construct was generated, in which the genomic region encoding the non-structural protein N(pro) was replaced by that of Bungowannah virus (CP7_N(pro)-Bungo). In vitro studies of CP7_N(pro)-Bungo revealed autonomous replication with the same efficacy as the BVDV backbone CP7 and infectious high-titer virus could be collected. In order to compare the ability of interferon (IFN) suppression, two reporter gene assays, specific for type-I IFN, were carried out. In virus-infected cells, no significant difference in blocking of IFN expression between the parental virus CP7, Bungowannah virus and the chimeric construct CP7_N(pro)-Bungo could be detected. In contrast, an N(pro) deletion mutant showed an impaired replication in bovine cells and a marked type-I IFN response. Taken together, our findings reveal the compatibility of non-structural protein N(pro) of atypical Bungowannah virus with a BVDV type 1 backbone and its characteristic feature as an inhibitor of type-I IFN induction with an inhibitor-activity comparable to other pestiviruses."

A class of boronated unnatural cyclic amino acids has demonstrated a remarkable selectivity toward tumors in animal and cell culture models, far superior to currently used agents in clinical BNCT. One of these amino acids, 1-amino-3-boronocyclopentanecarboxylic acid (ABCPC), has shown a tumor to blood ratio of 8 and a tumor to normal brain ratio of nearly 21 in a melanoma bearing mouse model. This work represents further biological characterization of this compound for tumor targeting in an EMT6 murine mammary carcinoma mouse model and a T98G human glioblastoma cell line. Female BALB/c mice bearing EMT6 tumors were injected with the fructose complex form of racemic mixtures of cis and trans isomers of ABCPC in identical concentrations. Boron concentrations were measured in the tumor, blood, brain, skin, and liver tissues at 1, 3, and 5 h post-injection. These observations revealed a remarkable difference in racemic mixtures of cis and trans isomers in tumor targeting by boron. This implies that further separation of the L and D forms of this compound may enhance tumor targeting to an even higher degree than that provided by the racemic mixtures. Since the uptake measurements were made in homogenized tumor and normal tissues, little is known about the subcellular location of the boron arising from the various isomeric forms of the amino acid. To study subcellular delivery of boron from ABCPC in T98G human glioblastoma cells, we employed secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) based technique of ion microscopy, which is capable of quantitatively imaging isotopic (elemental) gradients in cells and tissues at 500 nm spatial resolution. The T98G cells were exposed to the nutrient medium containing 100 ppm boron equivalent of a mixture of both L and D isomers of ABCPC in the form of a fructose complex for 1 h. Following this treatment, the cells were fast frozen, freeze-fractured, and freeze-dried for SIMS analysis. Within an hour of exposure, ABCPC provided partitioning of intracellular to extracellular boron of 3/1. SIMS imaging revealed that boron from ABCPC was distributed throughout the cell, including the nucleus. This level of boron delivery within an hour of exposure is superior to p-boronophenylalanine (BPA) and sodium borocaptate (BSH), which have been previously studied by SIMS in the same cell line. These encouraging observations provide compelling support for further isomeric separations of ABCPC into the D and L forms for enhanced tumor targeting and continued testing of these compounds as new boron carriers in BNCT."

Conversion patterns by crossed immunoelectrophoresis.,"Thirteen cerebrospinal fluid specimens (CSFs) from 10 patients with neuro-Behçet's syndrome (nB) were examined for the presence of conversion products of C3 protein by means of crossed immunoelectrophoresis. C3 conversion products were found in 4 CSFs from nB patients, and the proportions of the split products to the total immunoprecipitate zones were 17, 34, 61 and 63%, respectively. CSFs with C3 conversion patterns showed higher C3 protein (beta 1C/A) levels compared with those with non-conversion, whereas the differences of C4 protein (beta 1E) levels were unremarkable. CSF with C3 conversion patterns also showed apparent inflammatory characteristics indicating blood-CSF barrier involvement which would be deduced from increased alpha 2-macroglobulin and IgA, both being regarded as sensitive internal barrier parameters: but IgA measurement was much higher than usually expected values. It is suggested that the increase in CSF C3 might be initiated by accelerated consumption of complement through the alternative pathway, leading to hypersynthetic or hyperinflux response in CSF."

However, these methods can only look for the targeted substance but may miss unexpected toxicants. Furthermore, the synergistic effects of mixture cannot be detected. In order to set up the assay criteria for determining various biological activities at a cellular level that could potentially lead to toxicity of environmental water samples, a novel test based on cellular response by using Real-Time Cellular Analyzer (RTCA) is proposed in this study. First, the water sample is diluted to a series of strengths (80%, 60%, 40%, 30%, 20% and 10%) to get the multi-concentration cellular response profile. Then, the area under the cellular response profile (AUCRP) is calculated. Comparing to the normal cell growth of negative control, a new biological activity index named Percentage of Effect (PoE) has been presented which reflects the cumulative inhibitory activity of cell growth over the log-phase. Finally, a synthetical index PoE50 is proposed to evaluate the intensity of biological activities in water samples. The biological experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method. "

The challenge to pediatricians and other clinicians is to achieve and maintain such stringent treatment goals in children and adolescents, who are especially difficult to manage, without causing an unacceptably high rate of severe hypoglycemia.

Patients and families must be instructed on ways to reduce the risk for hypoglycemia and be able to recognize and treat hypoglycemic events that require assistance. New agents, such as insulin lispro, may enhance the ability to achieve strict glycemic control, but the treatment remains a burden. Nevertheless, in patients in whom treatment is successful, the improvement in long-term prognosis more than justifies the investment in time, effort, and resources."

To investigate the effect of triptolide on CCR5, we used complete Freund's adjuvant to produce adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) in rats. Our data show that both CCR5 mRNA and protein levels in synovial tissue of rats with AIA are significantly higher than those in normal rats. Triptolide can significantly inhibit rat AIA-induced overexpression of CCR5 at both mRNA and protein levels. These results may contribute to better understanding of the therapeutic effects of triptolide in rheumatoid arthritis."

Despite decades of postmortem, neuroimaging, pharmacological, and genetic studies of patients, in addition to animal models, much of the biological mechanisms that underlie the pathology of SZ remain unknown. The ability to reprogram adult somatic cells into human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) provides a new tool that supplies live human neurons for modeling complex genetic conditions such as SZ. The purpose of this review is to discuss the technical and clinical constraints currently limiting hiPSC-based studies. We posit that reducing the clinical heterogeneity of hiPSC-based studies, by selecting subjects with common clinical manifestations or rare genetic variants, will help our ability to draw meaningful insights from the necessarily small patient cohorts that can be studied at this time.

Ultra performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS) was applied and validated for the analysis of xanthone and secoiridoid glycoside a potential active component isolated from methanolic extracts of in vitro and in vivo Swertia chirayita plantlets. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a RP-C18 column using gradient elution. Mangiferin (Xanthone), Amarogentin and Swertiamarin (Secoiridoid glycosides) were identified in both the extracts. In the LC/ESI-MS spectra, major [M + H] (+) and [M + Na] (+) ions were observed in positive ion mode and provided molecular mass information. An ultra-performance liquid-chromatography in combination with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry involving metal cationisation was successfully utilized for the rapid identification of xanthone and secoiridoid glycosides. This method is suitable for the routine analysis, as well as for the separation and identification of known and novel secoiridoid glycoside and xanthone. "

We used data from a large nationally representative longitudinal study, the Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study. Initially based on a sample drawn from the 1971 Census, in 2001 this study included data on 110,464 people aged 40-59 of whom 5% provided 20 or more hours per week of unpaid care. We analysed associations between caregiving of this intensity and current employment, employment history, employment characteristics, marital status, and employment after childbearing. Among men, caregiving was associated with a history of lower levels of employment. The small group of men with a history of least employment were 70% more likely to provide care than those with a history of most employment. Among women, caregiving was associated with a history of non-employment, but there were no differences between those with fully engaged and partially engaged labour market histories. Analyses of a subset of data on women who had a child between 1981 and 1991 showed that those who had returned to full-time paid work by 1991 were over 50% less likely to later become caregivers. Some associations between employment characteristics and propensity to provide 20 or more hours per week of care were also identified. Those in public sector jobs and those previously in employment with a caregiving dimension were 20-30% more likely than other working women to provide unpaid care. These results suggest a continuing gender dimension in care provision which interacts with marital status and employment in gender-specific ways. It also suggests that implementation of strategies to enable those in midlife to combine caregiving and work responsibilities, should they wish to do so, should be an urgent priority."

The procedure uses standard PCR components including DNA from the test species and three primers: two universal external (upstream and downstream) limiting primers and a species-specific internal primer. Species identification requires the formation of a species-specific rDNA nucleotide segment that is significantly smaller (approximately 200 bp) than a non-target segment (approximately 600 bp). The procedure can be used to identify yeasts from single and mixed populations."

Pectin and modified pectin have been found to exhibit anti-mutagenic activity and inhibit cancer metastasis and proliferation, with no evidence of toxicity or other serious side effects. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of pectin at different degrees of esterification (DEs) on the expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages. Western blot and RT-PCR analyses demonstrated that 30% esterified pectin (DE30), DE60 pectin, and DE90 pectin significantly inhibited the protein and mRNA expressions of iNOS and COX-2 in LPS-activated macrophages, and DE90 pectin was the most-potent inhibitor. To clarify the mechanisms involved, DE90 pectin was found to inhibit the phosphorylation of MAPKs and IKK kinase activity. In addition, DE90 pectin inhibited the activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1 by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and transient transfection experiments. Finally, we found that DE90 pectin could bind with LPS, and might result in decreased binding of LPS to its receptor. These results suggest that modulation of iNOS and COX-2 expressions by dietary pectin may be important in cancer chemoprevention and anti-inflammation."
CD012599,First and second trimester serum tests with and without first trimester ultrasound tests for Down's syndrome screening," The aim of this review was to estimate and compare the accuracy of first and second trimester serum markers with and without first trimester ultrasound markers for the detection of Down’s syndrome in the antenatal period, as combinations of markers. Individual markers are described in the other reviews belonging to this suite. Accuracy is described by the proportion of fetuses with Down’s syndrome detected by screening before birth (sensitivity or detection rate) and the proportion of women with a low risk (normal) screening test result who subsequently had a baby unaffected by Down's syndrome (specificity).",19961843,0,"Twenty years on: the inner workings of the shoot apical meristem, a developmental dynamo.","The shoot apical meristem of angiosperm plants generates leaf, stem and floral structures throughout the plant's lifetime. To do this, the plant must maintain a population of stem cells within the meristem while at the same time carefully controlling the placement and establishment of new leaf primordia. As there is little cell rearrangement in plants, underlying patterning mechanisms must exert careful control of cell division rates and orientations to achieve the correct final form. It has been twenty years since the first genes controlling meristem development were molecularly cloned. In the intervening decades, our understanding of the inner workings directing meristem development has increased enormously. This review summarizes our current knowledge of how the meristem functions as a persistent organ generating center. The story that emerges is one in which transcription factor activity combines with the action of the classic plant growth regulators auxin and cytokinin and with the action of more recently discovered small peptides to control proliferation and cell fate in the shoot apical meristem."

The axillary plexus was identified with a nerve stimulator and 30, 35, or 40 mL of drug, depending on body weight, was injected into the perivascular sheath. In 20 patients, venous blood samples for the pharmacokinetic measurement were obtained over 24 h. The median onset times for anesthesia and complete motor block were in the range of 12-48 min and 5-20 min, respectively. Thirty-eight percent of patients in the ropivacaine group and 29% in the bupivacaine group needed additional nerve block(s) or supplementary analgesia and 7% in the bupivacaine group needed general anesthesia for surgery. Anesthesia was achieved in 52%-86% of the evaluated six nerves in the ropivacaine group and in 36%-87% in the bupivacaine group; the lowest figures were seen in the musculocutaneous nerve. In the pharmacokinetic study the mean peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) were 1.28 +/- 0.21 mg/L in the ropivacaine group and 1.28 +/- 0.47 mg/L in the bupivacaine group and the median times to peak plasma concentration (tmax) were 0.86 h and 0.96 h, respectively. The median terminal half-lives (t1/2) were 7.1 h and 11.5 h in the ropivacaine group and the bupivacaine group, respectively (P = 0.07). No statistically significant differences were found between ropivacaine and bupivacaine in either the clinical or the pharmacokinetic comparisons."

Ten years earlier, after laparotomy and pancreatic biopsy, she had been told that she had an inoperable pancreatic carcinoma. Review of that biopsy together with current hormonal assay now confirms the diagnosis of glucagonoma. The recurrent peptic ulcer in this patient despite high levels of glucagon, a gastric inhibitory agent, is noted but not explained. An enhanced amylase-creatinine clearance ratio supports the notion that glucagon increases the clearances of amylase."
CD008054,Human papillomavirus testing versus repeat cytology for triage of minor cytological cervical lesions," For studies where both triage methods, i.e. repeat cytology and the HC2 assay, were assessed: To assess the sensitivity and specificity of triage with HC2 and with repeat cytology to detect underlying cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 or worse (CIN2+), or grade 3 or worse (CIN3+), in women with an index smear showing ASCUS (triage group I) or LSIL (triage group II), and to compare the accuracy of both triage methods.",25634326,0,Spermiotoxicity and embryotoxicity of permethrin in the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus.,"The toxicity of permethrin on the fertilization and early development of sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus embryos were studied. Spermiotoxicity was evaluated on the basis of fertilization rate. Embryotoxicity was determined by comparing the frequency of normal development and malformations in embryos exposed to permethrin throughout their development. Permethrin inhibited fertilization success, and yielded IC25 and IC50 values of 0.58 (CL = 0.44-0.77) and 0.94 (CL = 0.92-0.95) µg/L, respectively. The embryotoxicity of permethrin was concentration dependent indicating a decreased percentage of normally developed plutei with increasing permethrin concentrations: IC25 = 0.195 µg/L (CL = 0.15-0.26) and IC50 = 0.346 µg/L (CF = 0.29-0.41). Associated with the decrease in normal pluteus frequency was an increase in larval malformations as skeleton deformities. The results suggest that permethrin is more highly toxic to embryos than to sperm, and that this insecticide may present a potential risk for the sea urchin in contaminated marine environments."

Therefore we looked at the diagnostic performance characteristics (Appendix 1) of the most used imaging modalities for this purpose: computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and bone scintigraphy.",19963874,0,A pipeline for automated analysis of flow cytometry data: preliminary results on lymphoma sub-type diagnosis.,"Flow cytometry (FCM) is widely used in health research and is a technique to measure cell properties such as phenotype, cytokine expression, etc., for up to millions of cells from a sample. FCM data analysis is a highly tedious, subjective and manually time-consuming (to the level of impracticality for some data) process that is based on intuition rather than standardized statistical inference. This study proposes a pipeline for automatic analysis of FCM data. The proposed pipeline identifies biomarkers that correlate with physiological/pathological conditions and classifies the samples to specific pathological/physiological entities. The pipeline utilizes a model-based clustering approach to identify cell populations that share similar biological functions. Support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) classifiers were then used to classify the samples and identify biomarkers associated with disease status. The performance of the proposed data analysis pipeline has been evaluated on lymphoma patients. Preliminary results show more than 90% accuracy in differentiating between some sub-types of lymphoma. The proposed pipeline also finds biologically meaningful biomarkers that differ between lymphoma subtypes."

We demonstrated that HSP72, the major heat-inducible form of the HSP70 group, is located on the cell surface of approximately 60% of the human colon carcinoma cells CX2 with two different mAbs by indirect immunofluorescence, by electron microscopy, and by selective cell surface biotinylation. In an effort to analyze the role of HSP72 cell surface expression as a tumor-specific recognition structure within an ""autologous"" tumor system, the CX2 cells were separated into a stably HSP72 high expressing (CX+: >90%) and a stably HSP72 low expressing (CX-: <20%) subline. The expression ""autologous"" was written in parentheses to indicate that the colon carcinoma sublines CX+ and CX- derived from the original CX2 tumor cell line differ with respect to the cell surface expression pattern of HSP72, whereas they exhibit an identical cell surface expression pattern of MHC and cellular adhesion molecules (e.g., intercellular cellular adhesion molecule, neural cellular adhesion molecule, vascular cellular adhesion molecule). Within this ""autologous"" tumor cell system, we demonstrate that the sensitivity to lysis mediated by adherent non-MHC-restricted effector cells correlates (p < 0.05) with the amount of HSP72 that is expressed on the cell surface. Blocking studies using an HSP72-specific mAb revealed that HSP72 might act in an MHC-unrestricted manner as a tumor-specific recognition structure for a distinct NK cell population."

For a successful result of AHSCT a sufficient quantity of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is needed. It has been proposed that morphological changes of myeloid cells could reflect the processes of bone marrow stimulation and may provide useful information to predict the stimulation efficiency and expected outcome of CD34(+) stem cells. The Beckman Coulter Cellular Analysis System DxH800 performs Flow Cytometric Digital Morphology analysis of leukocytes. All leukocyte cellular measurements can be reported as numerical values called Cell Population Data (CPD), which are able to detect morphological changes in the cell size and distribution of neutrophils. Our findings suggest that the changes in neutrophil CPD were detectable 2-4days before the observed increase in CD34(+) count in the peripheral blood and can potentially improve the management of patients. There was also a good correlation between MN-V-NE and ImmNeIndex with the CD34(+) count suggesting they can be used as a surrogate for the CD34(+) count (r=0.67 and 0.65 p<0.005 respectively). "

Since telomeres play an important role in the maintenance of chromosomal stability associated with continuous cell division, a key question for the quality of the resulting reprogrammed cells was to address whether nuclear reprogramming involves a full rejuvenation of telomeres. Recent work from our group and others demonstrate that telomeres are indeed rejuvenated during nuclear reprogramming. These findings also revealed that the structure of telomeric chromatin is dynamic and controlled by epigenetic programmes, which are reversed by reprogramming."

The huge increase of publications in both apoptosis and autophagic signaling pathways has contributed to the wealth of knowledge in facilitating the understanding of cancer pathogenesis. Deciphering the molecular pathways and molecules involved in these pathways has helped scientists devise and develop targeted strategies against cancer. Various drugs targeting the apoptotic TRAIL, Bcl-2 and proteasome pathways are already in Phase II/III clinical trials. The first mTOR inhibitor, temsirolimus has already been approved by the FDA, USA for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma and more mTOR inhibitors are expected to be in the market in a few years time.

CD009925,Second trimester serum tests for Down's Syndrome screening,"The aim of this review was to estimate and compare the accuracy of second trimester serum markers for the detection of Down’s syndrome in the antenatal period, both as individual markers and as combinations of markers. Accuracy is described by the proportion of fetuses with Down’s syndrome detected by screening before birth (sensitivity or detection rate) and the proportion of women with a low risk (normal) screening test result who subsequently had a baby unaffected by Down's syndrome (specificity). We grouped our analyses to focus on investigating the value of adding increasing numbers of markers (comparing single, dual, triple and quadruple tests), and of including Inhibin A, the most recent routine addition to serum marker combinations. Investigation of sources of heterogeneity We investigated whether a uniform screening test is suitable for all women, or whether different screening methods are more applicable to different groups, defined by advanced maternal age, ethnic groups and aspects of the pregnancy and medical history such as multiple pregnancy, diabetes and family history of Down's syndrome.

This led to an increase in the incorporation of L-fucose into total proteins which were measured in the hippocampus 7-9 hours later. In behavioral experiments, the same application improved the retention of a learned task. A possible linkage between increased glycoprotein synthesis and improvement of the retention of a new learned behavior due to the action of apomorphine is discussed."

Midas_ grown with roots at 10°C and shoots at 20°C, compared with whole plants grown at 20°C. There were diurnal fluctuations in NRA in roots from both treatments, but they were much greater in roots grown at 20°C, where NRA fell to a very low value in the dark period. The diurnal fluctuations in the malate content of the roots were also related to the root growth temperature. Plants with roots grown at the lower temperature had a higher malate content, especially in the dark period where it was 20 times greater than in plants with roots at 20°C. At all times there was a three-fold increase in soluble carbohydrate in cooled roots and diurnal fluctuations were much less pronounced than those of malate. Growth at low temperatures increased the total flux of amino N into the xylem sap and increased the proportion of reduced N in the total N flux. At certain times of day both 10°C- and 20°C-grown roots responded to exogeneous malate by increasing the flux of amino acid into the xylem sap, although this effect was always more pronounced in 20°C-grown roots.

The reductive branch to 4-methylpentanoate proceeds by means of the dehydration of (R)-2-hydroxy-4-methylpentanoyl-CoA to 4-methylpent-2-enoyl-CoA, which is chemically the most demanding step. Ketyl radicals have been proposed to mediate this reaction catalysed by an iron-sulphur-cluster-containing dehydratase, which requires activation by ATP-dependent electron transfer from a second iron-sulphur protein functionally similar to the iron protein of nitrogenase. Here we identify a kinetically competent product-related allylic ketyl radical bound to the enzyme by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy employing isotope-labelled (R)-2-hydroxy-4-methylpentanoyl-CoA species. We also found that the enzyme generated the stabilized pentadienoyl ketyl radical from the substrate analogue 2-hydroxypent-4-enoyl-CoA, supporting the proposed mechanism. Our results imply that also other 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratases and the related benzoyl-CoA reductases-present in anaerobically living bacteria-employ ketyl radical intermediates. The absence of radical generators such as coenzyme B12, S-adenosylmethionine or oxygen makes these enzymes unprecedented in biochemistry."

This study characterized the planar biaxial properties of tissue-engineered valve leaflets and native aortic valve leaflets. Fibrin-based valve equivalent (VE) and porcine aortic valve (PAV) leaflets were subjected to incremental biaxial stress relaxation testing, during which fiber alignments were measured, over a range of strain ratios. Results showed that VE leaflets exhibited a modulus and fiber reorientation behavior that correlated with strain ratio. In contrast, PAV leaflets maintained their relaxed modulus and fiber alignment when exposed to nonequibiaxial strain, but exhibited changes in stress relaxation. In uniaxial and equi-biaxial tension, there were few observed differences in relaxation behavior between VE and PAV leaflets, despite differences in the modulus and fiber reorientation. Likewise, in both tissues there was similar relaxation response in the circumferential and radial directions in biaxial tension, despite different moduli in these two directions. This study presents some fundamental differences in the mechanical response to biaxial tension of fibrin-based tissue-engineered constructs and native valve tissue. It also highlights the importance of using a range of strain ratios when generating mechanical property data for valvular and engineered tissues. The data presented on the stress-strain, relaxation, and fiber reorientation of VE tissue will be useful in future efforts to mathematically model and improve fibrin-based tissue-engineered constructs."

Functional magnetic resonance imaging of the entire lower thoracic, lumbar, and sacral spinal cord was performed using a sexual stimulation paradigm designed to elicit psychological and physical components of sexual arousal. Responses were measured in 9 healthy adult women during 3 consecutive conditions: (a) erotic audiovisual, (b) manual clitoral, and (c) audiovisual plus manual stimulation. Functional magnetic resonance imaging results in healthy subjects demonstrate that this method is sensitive for mapping sexual function in the spinal cord, and identify several key regions involved in human sexual response, including the intermediolateral cell column, the dorsal commissural nucleus, and the sacral parasympathetic nucleus. Using spinal functional magnetic resonance imaging, this study identified many of the spinal cord regions involved in female sexual responses. Results from audiovisual and manual clitoral stimulation correspond with previous data regarding lumbar and sacral neurologic changes during sexual arousal. This study provides the first characterization of neural activity in the human spinal cord underlying healthy female sexual responses and sets a foundation for future studies aimed at mapping changes that result from sexual dysfunction, spinal cord trauma or disease."

Plasma clearance and urinary excretion of stable strontium tracers of strontium-84 ((84)Sr) and strontium-86 ((86)Sr) were measured in GSF-National Research Center for Environment and Health (GSF) in 13 healthy German adult subjects after intravenous injection and oral administration. The biological half-life of strontium in plasma was evaluated from 49 plasma concentration data sets following intravenous injections. This value was used to determine the transfer rates from plasma to other organs and tissues. At the same time, the long-term retention of strontium in soft tissue and whole body was constrained to be consistent with measured values available. A physiological urinary path was integrated into the biokinetic model of strontium. Parameters were estimated using our own measured urinary excretion values. Retention and excretion of strontium were modeled using compartmental transfer rates published by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), the SENES Oak Ridge Inc. (SENES), and the Urals Research Center for Radiation Medicine (TBM). The results were compared with values calculated by applying our GSF parameters (GSF). For the dose estimation of (89)Sr, a bone metastases model (GSF-M) was developed by adding a compartment, representing the metastases, into the strontium biokinetic model. The related parameters were evaluated based on measured data available in the literature. A set of biokinetic parameters was optimized to represent not only the early plasma kinetics of strontium but also the long-term retention measured in soft tissue and whole body. The ingestion dose coefficients of (90)Sr were computed and compared with different biokinetic model parameters. The ingestion dose coefficients were calculated as 2.8 x 10(-8), 2.1 x 10(-8), 2.5 x 10(-8) and 3.8 x 10(-8) Sv Bq(-1) for ICRP, SENES, TBM and GSF model parameters, respectively. Moreover, organ absorbed dose for the radiopharmaceutical of (89)Sr in bone metastases therapy was estimated based on the GSF and ICRP biokinetic model parameters. The effective doses were 3.3, 1.8 and 1.2 mSv MBq(-1) by GSF, GSF-M, and ICRP Publication 67 model parameters, respectively, compared to the value of 3.1 mSv MBq(-1) reported by ICRP Publication 80. The absorbed doses of red bone marrow and bone surface, 17 and 21 mGy MBq(-1) calculated by GSF parameters, and 7.1 and 8.8 mGy MBq(-1) by GSF-M parameters, are comparable to the clinical results of 3-19 mGy MBq(-1) for bone marrow and 16 mGy MBq(-1) for bone surface. Based on the GSF-M model, the absorbed dose of (89)Sr to metastases was estimated to be 434 mGy MBq(-1). The strontium clearance half-life of 0.25 h from the plasma obtained in the present study is obviously faster than the value of 1.1 h recommended by ICRP. There are no significant changes for ingestion dose coefficients of (90)Sr using different model parameters. A model including the metastases was particularly developed for dose estimation of (89)Sr treatment for the pain of bone metastases."

Abberant activity of PP2A has been associated with a number of diseases. The homolog PPP2CA and PPP2CB can each function as the phosphatase catalytic subunit generally referred to as PP2AC. We generated a Ppp2ca conditional knockout (CKO) in C57BL/6J mice. Exon 2 of Ppp2ca was knocked out in a spatial or temporal-specific manner in primordial germ cells at E12.5. This Ppp2ca-null mutation caused infertility in male C57BL/6J mice. These CKO mice provide a powerful tool to study the mechanisms of Ppp2ca in development and disease. "

Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of gene expression, playing crucial roles in plant growth, development, and stress tolerance. Next generation sequencing of miRNAs from leaves of control Arabidopsis and from plants subjected to three treatments (ANE, NaCl and ANE+NaCl) was used to identify ANE-responsive miRNA in the absence and presence of saline conditions. Differential gene expression analysis revealed that ANE had a strong effect on miRNAs expression in both conditions. In the presence of salinity, ANE tended to reduce the up-regulation or the down-regulation trend induced caused by NaCl in miRNAs such as ath-miR396a-5p, ath-miR399, ath-miR2111b and ath-miR827. To further uncover the effects of ANE, the expression of several target genes of a number of ANE-responsive miRNAs was analyzed by qPCR. NaCl, but not ANE, down-regulated miR396a-5p, which negatively regulated the expression of AtGRF7 leading to a higher expression of AtDREB2a and AtRD29 in the presence of ANE+NaCl, as compared to ANE alone. ANE+NaCl initially reduced and then enhanced the expression of ath-miR169g-5p, while the expression of the target genes AtNFYA1 and ATNFYA2, known to be involved in the salinity tolerance mechanism, was increased as compared to ANE or to NaCl treatments. ANE and ANE+NaCl modified the expression of ath-miR399, ath-miR827, ath-miR2111b, and their target genes AtUBC24, AtWAK2, AtSYG1 and At3g27150, suggesting a role of ANE in phosphate homeostasis. In vivo and in vitro experiments confirmed the improved growth of Arabidopsis in presence of ANE, in saline conditions and in phosphate-deprived medium, further substantiating the influence of ANE on a variety of essential physiological processes in Arabidopsis including salinity tolerance and phosphate uptake."

The production and characterization of monoclonal antibody BA-2 by immunization with a pre-B-ALL cell line has been reported previously. In this study we utilized complement-dependent cytotoxicity and rosette-separation with antibody indirectly coupled to ox RBC to determine if the antigen (p24) recognized by the antibody BA-2 is represented on human pluripotential (CFU-GEMM) or committed hematopoietic progenitors (CFU-GM, BFU-E, CFU-E). BA-2 showed no reactivity with normal hematopoietic progenitors by either method. In contrast, BA-2 exhibited potent complement-mediated cytotoxicity for selected ALL-derived cell lines. These results show that normal human hematopoietic progenitors do no express antigenic sites represented on ALL cells that are recognized by BA-2 and suggest that this monoclonal antibody may serve as a potent and specific agent for treatment of lymphocytic leukemia, perhaps most useful in ex vivo marrow conditioning for autologous bone marrow transplantation."

Previous smaller studies suggested that highly purified eicosapentaenoic acid lowered triglyceride (TG) levels without increasing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. TG-lowering therapies such as fibrates, and fish oils containing both eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, can substantially increase LDL cholesterol levels when administered to patients with very high TG levels (≥500 mg/dl). The present double-blind study randomized 229 diet-stable patients with fasting TG ≥500 mg/dl and ≤2,000 mg/dl (with or without background statin therapy) to AMR101 4 g/day, AMR101 2 g/day, or placebo. The primary end point was the placebo-corrected median percentage of change in TG from baseline to week 12. The baseline TG level was 680, 657, and 703 mg/dl for AMR101 4 g/day, AMR101 2 g/day, and placebo. AMR101 4 g/day reduced the placebo-corrected TG levels by 33.1% (n = 76, p <0.0001) and AMR101 2 g/day by 19.7% (n = 73, p = 0.0051). For a baseline TG level >750 mg/dl, AMR101 4 g/day reduced the placebo-corrected TG levels by 45.4% (n = 28, p = 0.0001) and AMR101 2 g/day by 32.9% (n = 28, p = 0.0016). AMR101 did not significantly increase the placebo-corrected median LDL cholesterol levels at 4 g/day (-2.3%) or 2 g/day (+5.2%; both p = NS). AMR101 significantly reduced non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total cholesterol. AMR101 was generally well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of the placebo. In conclusion, the present randomized, double-blind trial of patients with very high TG levels demonstrated that AMR101 significantly reduced the TG levels and improved other lipid parameters without significantly increasing the LDL cholesterol levels."

These tumors are usually invasive, may exhibit aggressive clinical behavior, and often recur with a low success of cure after reoperation and/or radiotherapy. Due to their rarity, they present great difficulties in assessing prognosis, treatment, and clinical management. Neurosurgeons and physicians dealing with pituitary adenomas diagnosed as Crooke's cell adenomas have to be aware of their potential clinical aggressiveness to plan strict follow-up of patients and eventual multimodality treatment. We review here the published cases of Crooke's cell tumors, as well as the clinical and histopathological characteristics of these unusual neoplasms."

From the results, it was observed that immediately after dissolution in an acetic acid aqueous solution and subsequent casting over the ATR crystal, the formed carboxylate antimicrobial (-NH3+ -OOCH) species are not stable in the film formulation and become reduced over time; further assays confirmed previous research, which suggested that the presence and stability of these groups is strongly dependent, among other factors, on storage conditions. As-received chitosan and chitosan neutralized in NaOH films did not exhibit biocide performance towards Staphylococcus aureus. The antimicrobial tests were also found to strongly relate the presence of a sufficient quantity of these carboxylate groups to the chitosan activity as a biocide agent. Moreover, a novel methodology based on the use of a normalized infrared band centered at 1405 cm(-1) is proposed which can be correlated with the antimicrobial character of the biopolymer."

Methionine Synthase Reductase (MTRR) is one of several key enzymes in the homocysteine metabolic pathway and its mutant forms have been implicated in abnormal homocysteine accumulation. In this study, we determined total plasma homocysteine levels and MTRR A66G polymorphism in 114 patients with vascular disease: 58 patients with deep-vein thrombosis, 56 patients with arterial thrombosis, and 95 healthy subjects from the Sicilian population. Our data confirmed that, as already reported, moderately elevated t-Hcy levels are correlated with an increased risk of vascular disease. In our study, the levels of t-Hcy found in both deep-vein thrombosis (13.7+/-3.2 micromol/L) and arterial thrombosis (14.3+/-4.3 micromol/L) patient groups were higher than levels detected in normal subjects (8.7+/-2.7 micromol/L). We concluded that the MTRR A66G polymorphism was not associated with the t-Hcy plasma concentration because the same genotype frequency distribution was detected in both patients and healthy individuals."

However, less is known about reasons for discontinuation. The purpose of this study was to develop two measures of reasons for discontinuation or continuation of antipsychotics for the treatment of schizophrenia. Based on literature review, a patient interview pilot study, and expert panel input, two measures were drafted: the clinician-reported Reasons for Antipsychotic Discontinuation/Continuation Questionnaire (RAD-Q) and the patient-reported Reasons for Antipsychotic Discontinuation/Continuation Interview (RAD-I). Patients and clinicians completed the draft measures and structured cognitive debriefing interviews. For the draft instruments, reasons for discontinuation/continuation were divided into 3 categories: therapeutic benefits (positive symptoms, negative symptoms, mood, cognition, functional status), adverse events, and reasons other than direct effects of the medication (e.g., cost, inadequate social support). In cognitive debriefings, 10 clinicians and 15 patients indicated that the RAD-Q and RAD-I were clear, easy to complete, and comprehensive. Clinicians and patients suggested minor revisions, and the instruments were revised accordingly. The RAD-Q and RAD-I appear to be useful instruments for assessing reasons for antipsychotic discontinuation and continuation. The next step is a psychometric evaluation of the measures in a larger sample."

This preeminence is reflected in superior medical education, the attraction of U.S. educational institutions to foreign visitors seeking advanced training, and a high rate of transfer of knowledge between basic biomedical research and the delivery of health care at the bedside. The foundation for this excellence and leadership has been the research carried out by MD and PhD biomedical scientists. It has been suggested that there is now an oversupply of BMS PhDs, and thus that BMS PhD programs should be downsized. Full examination of the issues involved, including a case study of doctoral graduates and postdoctoral fellows at Tulane Medical Center, leads the authors to conclude that a biomedical PhD ""glut"" does not exist at the present time, that downsizing training programs would have a serious, long-term negative impact on biomedical research, and that medical school administrators and faculty should resist attempts to reduce biomedical research and training at the local and national level. However, times have changed and training programs must evolve to adapt to the technologic changes occurring in the workplace. Alternatives, such as new alliances with industry, must be sought to compensate for decreased resources at federal and institutional levels; new and innovative curricula must be developed to prepare biomedical scientists for nonacademic, as well as academic, job opportunities in the twenty-first century; and medical center administrators and faculties must work together to increase the visibility of BMS and stress its critical relationship to the research base of the nation."
CD008170,First‐line drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system versus other first‐line antihypertensive drug classes for hypertension,  available in English Español To evaluate the benefits and harms of first‐line RAS inhibitors compared to other first‐line antihypertensive drugs in people with hypertension.,25582792,0,Lack of pulse and surge modes and glutamatergic stimulation of luteinising hormone release in Kiss1 knockout rats.,"Kisspeptin, encoded by the Kiss1 gene, has attracted attention as a key candidate neuropeptide in controlling puberty and reproduction via regulation of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion in mammals. Pioneer studies with Kiss1 or its cognate receptor Gpr54 knockout (KO) mice showed the indispensable role of kisspeptin-GPR54 signalling in the control of animal reproduction, although detailed analyses of gonadotrophin secretion, especially pulsatile and surge-mode of luteinising hormone (LH) secretion, were limited. Thus, in the present study, we have generated Kiss1 KO rats aiming to evaluate a key role of kisspeptin in governing reproduction via pulse and surge modes of GnRH/LH secretion. Kiss1 KO male and female rats showed a complete suppression of pulsatile LH secretion, which is responsible for folliculogenesis and spermatogenesis, and an absence of puberty and atrophic gonads. Kiss1 KO female rats showed no spontaneous LH/follicle-stimulating hormone surge and an oestrogen-induced LH surge, suggesting that the GnRH surge generation system, which is responsible for ovulation, does not function without kisspeptin. Furthermore, challenge of major stimulatory neurotransmitters, such as monosodium glutamate, NMDA and norepinephrine, failed to stimulate LH secretion in Kiss1 KO rats, albeit they stimulated LH release in wild-type controls. Taken together, the results of the present study confirm that kisspeptin plays an indispensable role in generating two modes (pulse and surge) of GnRH/gonadotrophin secretion to regulate puberty onset and normal reproductive performance. In addition, the present study suggests that kisspeptin neurones play a critical role as a hub integrating major stimulatory neural inputs to GnRH neurones, using newly established Kiss1 KO rats, which serve as a useful model for detailed analysis of hormonal profiles.

This threshold represents an estimated upper limit for sulfur isotope mass-independent fractionation (S-MIF), an Archean signature of atmospheric anoxia that begins to disappear from the rock record at 2.45 Ga. However, an increasing number of papers have suggested that the timing for oxidative continental weathering, and by conventional thinking the onset of atmospheric oxygenation, was hundreds of million years earlier than previously thought despite the presence of S-MIF. We suggest that this apparent discrepancy can be resolved by the earliest oxidative-weathering reactions occurring in benthic and soil environments at profound redox disequilibrium with the atmosphere, such as biological soil crusts and freshwater microbial mats covering riverbed, lacustrine, and estuarine sediments. We calculate that oxygenic photosynthesis in these millimeter-thick ecosystems provides sufficient oxidizing equivalents to mobilize sulfate and redox-sensitive trace metals from land to the oceans while the atmosphere itself remained anoxic with its attendant S-MIF signature. As continental freeboard increased significantly between 3.0 and 2.5 Ga, the chemical and isotopic signatures of benthic oxidative weathering would have become more globally significant from a mass-balance perspective. These observations help reconcile evidence for pre-GOE oxidative weathering with the history of atmospheric chemistry, and support the plausible antiquity of a terrestrial biosphere populated by cyanobacteria well before the GOE.

CXCL10 (interferon-gamma inducible protein-10, IP-10) is a small secretory protein of 8.7 kDa. Recently, it has been shown that normal prostate epithelial (PZ-HPV-7) cells produce lower amounts of angiogenic CXC chemokines (GRO-alpha, IL-8) and higher amounts of angiostatic chemokines (CXCL10, CXCL11) as compared to prostate cancer cells (CA-HPV-10 and PC-3). Accordingly, we studied the effects of overexpression of CXCL10 in human prostate cancer LNCaP cells. LNCaP cells were transiently transfected with CXCL10 cDNA in pIRES2-EGFP vector. CXCL10, CXCR3, PSA and G3PDH mRNA levels were determined by semi-quantitative conventional and quantitative real-time RT-PCR and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The expression of CXCL10 was markedly enhanced in the transfected cells at mRNA and protein levels in the cells. Overexpression of CXCL10 inhibited cell proliferation of the transfected cells by 30%-40% in serum-limited medium (1% FCS in RPMI1640 medium) and decreased PSA production. CXCR3 expression was significantly induced by the overexpression of CXCL10 as determined by RT-PCR and FACS. These results indicated that CXCL10 inhibited LNCaP cell proliferation and decreased PSA production by up-regulation of CXCR3 receptor. CXCL10 may be potentially useful in the treatment of prostate cancer."

In response to these challenges, a variety of new diagnostics have emerged. These include interferon-gamma release assays for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis (TB) infection and novel culture methods and molecular assays for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis. Although some tests (such as interferon-gamma release assays) are not clearly superior to existing diagnostics, other novel diagnostics, such as real-time polymerase chain reaction and the microscopic observed direct susceptibility assay hold much promise for prompt and accurate TB diagnosis in this population. Line-probe, nitrate reductase, and mycobacteriophage assays have also provided rapid alternatives to conventional time-consuming drug susceptibility testing and are critical to curtailing the spread of multidrug-resistant TB."

Bayesian methods have been proposed to test biogeographic hypotheses while accommodating uncertainty in phylogenetic reconstruction. However, the problem that certain taxa may have a disproportionate influence on conclusions has not been addressed. Here, we infer the geographic origin of Drosophila simulans using 2,014 bp of the period locus from 63 lines collected from 18 countries. We also analyze two previously published datasets, alcohol dehydrogenase related and NADH:ubiquinone reductase 75 kDa subunit precursor. Phylogenetic inferences of all three loci support Madagascar as the geographic origin of D. simulans. Our phylogenetic conclusions are robust to taxon resampling and to the potentially confounding effects of recombination. To test our phylogenetically derived hypothesis we develop a randomization test of the population genetics prediction that sequences from the geographic origin should contain more genetic polymorphism than those from derived populations. We find that the Madagascar population has elevated genetic polymorphism relative to non-Madagascar sequences. These data are corroborated by mitochondrial DNA sequence data."

In this mini-review, we focus on Olig2 in the forebrain (telencephalon and diencephalon) and discuss the functional significance of Olig2 and the differentiation properties of Olig2-expressing progenitors in the development and injured states. Short- and long-term lineage analysis in the developing forebrain elucidated that not all late Olig2+ cells are direct cohorts of early cells and that Olig2 lineage cells differentiate into neurons or glial cells in a region- and stage-dependent manner. Olig2-deficient mice revealed large elimination of oligodendrocyte precursor cells and a decreased number of astrocyte progenitors in the dorsal cortex, whereas no reduction in the number of GABAergic neurons. In addition to Olig2 function in the developing cortex, Olig2 is also reported to be important for glial scar formation after injury. Thus, Olig2 can be essential for glial differentiation during development and after injury."

We also examined the physical tests according to whether they were intended to: identify impingement in general (or differentiate it from other causes of shoulder pain, e.g. 'frozen shoulder') subcategorise impingement as subacromial outlet impingement (impingement under the acromion process) or internal impingement (impingement within the shoulder joint) diagnose lesions of bursa, tendon or glenoid labrum that may be associated with impingement form part of a diagnostic package or process and, if so, according to the stages at which they may apply. Investigation of sources of heterogeneity We planned to investigate the following potential sources of heterogeneity. Study population: older general population; young athletic population; other well defined groups e.g. wheelchair users or swimmers (see the Differences between protocol and review) Stage of clinical care: primary (generally in the community setting), secondary (referral following preliminary screening) or tertiary (referral to a specialist centre) Study design: cross sectional (or cohort) versus case-control; retrospective versus prospective design Type of reference test.

The dsx gene is involved in Drosophila sex determination. We have identified two RNA target sequence motifs recognized by the SR protein RBP1 from Drosophila using an in vitro selection approach. Several copies of these RBP1 target sequences were found within two regions of the dsx pre-mRNA which are important for the regulation of dsx alternative splicing, the repeat region and the purine-rich polypyrimidine tract of the regulated female-specific 3' splice site. We show that RBP1 target sequences within the dsx repeat region are required for the efficient splicing of dsx pre-mRNA. Moreover, our studies reveal that RBP1 contributes to the activation of female-specific dsx splicing in vivo by recognizing the RBP1 target sequences within the purine-rich polypyrimidine tract of the female-specific 3' splice site."

Several human observational studies show an association between menstrual cycle irregularities and a hyperandrogenic environment and that may result in a potential alteration of the female reproductive tract during in-utero development. This study examined associations between AGD of young women and their mother's gynaecological characteristics before or during pregnancy. This is cross-sectional study of 100 college-age volunteers in southern Spain. Physical and gynaecological examinations were conducted on the young women and they and their mothers completed epidemiological questionnaires on lifestyles and gynaecological history. Linear regression analysis was used to examine the association between AGD measurements (anus-fourchette (AGDAF) and anus-clitoris (AGDAC)) of women and their mother's gynaecological characteristics. Longer AGDAF was associated with the presence of mother's menstrual cycle irregularities before pregnancy (P=0.03). Longer female AGD has been related to excess androgen exposure in utero in toxicological studies. The current findings may be consistent with studies in which an association between menstrual cycle irregularities and an hyperandrogenic environment has been reported, which therefore may result in a potential modification of the female offspring's reproductive tract during in-utero development, including AGD. Rodent models suggest that perineal length at birth reflects male hormone concentrations (androgens) during in-utero development and predicts adult perineal length. Several human studies show a relationship between menstrual cycle irregularities and an excessive androgen environment. We hypothesize that androgen excess may result in a potential alteration of the female reproductive tract during in-utero development. Our aim was to examine associations between perineal length of young women and their mother's gynaecological characteristics before or during pregnancy. This is a study of 100 college-age volunteers in Southern Spain. Physical and gynaecological examinations were conducted on the young women and they and their mothers completed epidemiological questionnaires on lifestyles and gynaecological history. We used multivariate analyses to assess the association between perineal length of women and their mother's gynaecological characteristics. Longer perineal length was associated with the presence of mother's menstrual cycle irregularities before pregnancy. Longer female perineal length has been related to excess androgen exposure in utero in rodent studies. Our findings may be consistent with previous studies in which an association between menstrual cycle irregularities and an excess of androgen has been reported, which therefore may result in a potential modification of the female offspring's reproductive tract during in-utero development, including perineal length.

Therefore, we examined longitudinal mucosal, plasma cytokine profiles and viral-specific T-cell responses (vSTRs) before and during weekly repeated low-dose SHIV(SF162P3) viral challenges in six female pigtailed macaques, even in the absence of overt systemic infection. Following a single viral challenge, induction of several cytokines was detected consistently in cervico-vaginal lavages (CVL). With additional exposure and documented systemic infection, a hallmark of response profile was defined as peak levels in both CVL (MCP-1, MIP-1alpha, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-1RA and IL-8) and plasma cytokines (MCP-1, eotaxin and IL-1RA) in the macaques. In the periphery, vSTRs were observed within the first one or two viral challenges, but prior to the detection of systemic infection in 5/6 exposed pigtailed macaques. These findings provide valuable information regarding mucosal HIV-1 infection that may benefit microbicide research and development."
CD011975,First trimester serum tests for Down's syndrome screening," The aim of this review was to estimate and compare the accuracy of first trimester serum markers for the detection of Down’s syndrome in the antenatal period, both as individual markers and as combinations of markers. Accuracy is described by the proportion of fetuses with Down’s syndrome detected by screening before birth (sensitivity or detection rate), and the proportion of women with a low risk (normal) screening test result who subsequently had a baby unaffected by Down's syndrome (specificity). Investigation of sources of heterogeneity We planned to investigate whether a uniform screening test is suitable for all women, or whether different screening methods are more applicable to different groups, defined by advanced maternal age, ethnic groups and aspects of the pregnancy and medical history such as multiple pregnancy, diabetes and family history of Down's syndrome. We also considered whether there existed evidence of overestimation of test accuracy in studies evaluating risk equations in the derivation sample rather than in a separate validation sample.",25526647,0,High follicle density does not decrease sweat gland density in Huacaya alpacas.,"When exposed to high ambient temperatures, mammals lose heat evaporatively by either sweating from glands in the skin or by respiratory panting. Like other camelids, alpacas are thought to evaporate more water by sweating than panting, despite a thick fleece, unlike sheep which mostly pant in response to heat stress. Alpacas were brought to Australia to develop an alternative fibre industry to sheep wool. In Australia, alpacas can be exposed to ambient temperatures higher than in their native South America. As a young industry there is a great deal of variation in the quality and quantity of the fleece produced in the national flock. There is selection pressure towards animals with finer and denser fleeces. Because the fibre from secondary follicles is finer than that from primary follicles, selecting for finer fibres might alter the ratio of primary and secondary follicles. In turn the selection might alter sweat gland density because the sweat glands are associated with the primary follicle. Skin biopsy and fibre samples were obtained from the mid-section of 33 Huacaya alpacas and the skin sections were processed into horizontal sections at the sebaceous gland level. Total, primary, and secondary follicles and the number of sweat gland ducts were quantified. Fibre samples from each alpaca were further analysed for mean fibre diameter. The finer-fibred animals had a higher total follicle density (P<0.001) and more sweat glands (P<0.001) than the thicker-fibred animals. The fibre diameter and total follicle density were negatively correlated (R(2)=0.56, P<0.001). Given that the finer-fibred animals had higher follicle density and more sweat glands than animals with thicker fibres, we conclude that alpacas with high follicle density should not be limited for potential sweating ability.

By virtue of their extremely large surface-to-volume ratio, the silver particles serve as a depot for sustained release of silver ions, despite the fact that silver is not readily oxidized. Antimicrobial coatings are especially important in connection with indwelling catheters with a high risk of bacterial line infections, such as central venous catheters (CVCs). This study specifically addressed the question what the impact of silver nanoparticles (exposed at the coating's surface) and/or the release of silver ions would be on coagulation of contacting blood. Studies, performed in vitro with fresh platelet-rich blood plasma (PRP) from 5 different healthy volunteer donors, clearly pointed out that: (i) the presence of silver nanoparticles correlates with accelerated thrombin formation upon contact of the coating with PRP; (ii) platelet activation is stronger as a result from the contact with silver nanoparticle-containing coatings as compared to other coatings which are devoid of silver. A series of titration experiments, in which the potential effect of silver ions is mimicked, revealed that the observed activation of blood platelets can be best explained through a collision mechanism. The results suggest that platelets that collide with silver, exposed at the surface, become activated without adhering to the surface. These new results point, rather unexpectedly, at a double effect of the silver nanoparticles in the coating: a strong antimicrobial effect occurs simultaneously with acceleration of the coagulation of contacting blood. This new information is, evidently, most relevant for the development of improved surface coatings for indwelling catheters (such as CVCs) which should combine antimicrobial features and close-to-zero thrombogenicity."

CD012599,First and second trimester serum tests with and without first trimester ultrasound tests for Down's syndrome screening," The aim of this review was to estimate and compare the accuracy of first and second trimester serum markers with and without first trimester ultrasound markers for the detection of Down’s syndrome in the antenatal period, as combinations of markers. Individual markers are described in the other reviews belonging to this suite. Accuracy is described by the proportion of fetuses with Down’s syndrome detected by screening before birth (sensitivity or detection rate) and the proportion of women with a low risk (normal) screening test result who subsequently had a baby unaffected by Down's syndrome (specificity).",24338251,0,Image analysis technique as a tool to identify morphological changes in Trametes versicolor pellets according to exopolysaccharide or laccase production.,"Image analysis technique was applied to identify morphological changes of pellets from white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor on agitated submerged cultures during the production of exopolysaccharide (EPS) or ligninolytic enzymes. Batch tests with four different experimental conditions were carried out. Two different culture media were used, namely yeast medium or Trametes defined medium and the addition of lignolytic inducers as xylidine or pulp and paper industrial effluent were evaluated. Laccase activity, EPS production, and final biomass contents were determined for batch assays and the pellets morphology was assessed by image analysis techniques. The obtained data allowed establishing the choice of the metabolic pathways according to the experimental conditions, either for laccase enzymatic production in the Trametes defined medium, or for EPS production in the rich Yeast Medium experiments. Furthermore, the image processing and analysis methodology allowed for a better comprehension of the physiological phenomena with respect to the corresponding pellets morphological stages. "

Decisions on the individual development strategy should be made prior to the start of development and all projects should be reviewed at predefined stages throughout the product development life cycle. This ensures consistency of decision-making not only during the development of individual products but throughout the entire development pipeline. Studies in the exploratory stage of drug development should be designed for decision making in contrast to later clinical trials in the confirmatory stage that require power for proof-of-safety and proof-of-efficacy. The more thorough and profound studies have been carried out during this exploratory stage of drug development, the earlier a decision can be made on the continuation or discontinuation of further development, thus saving development time and money and assessing and considerably reducing the risk for the patients and increasing the success rate of the project in the later confirmatory effectiveness trial with an adequate number of subjects receiving the new therapy under typical conditions of use. Strategies which may be helpful to improve the quality of decisions in drug discovery and drug development are: discovery experiments should be done to critically evaluate the compound, the ""killer"" experiments should be done as early as possible, continuous effort on preclinical disease models is necessary to improve predictability of efficacy in patients (""humanized"" research): genomic technology should be used to identify novel, disease-related targets and to characterise preclinical test systems, improvement of knowledge and experience concerning the relevance of new technologies for the clinical picture, genotyping of clinical trial patients to select patient groups which are likely to respond to treatment (pharmacogenomics), modelling and simulation of preclinical and clinical trials, integration of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles into drug development, assessment of the interaction potential (CYP-450, trasporter proteins and others), increasing use of biomarker/surrogate marker for rapid clinical feedback, involvement of the target population as soon as possible, applying statistical data analysis techniques for proving effectiveness, co-operation with high quality centers. To reach this goal clinical pharmacology must be fully integrated in the whole process from the candidate selection to its positioning within the market."

Accuracy is described by the proportion of fetuses with Down’s syndrome detected by screening before birth (sensitivity or detection rate), and the proportion of women with a low risk (normal) screening test result who subsequently had a baby unaffected by Down's syndrome (specificity). Investigation of sources of heterogeneity We planned to investigate whether a uniform screening test is suitable for all women, or whether different screening methods are more applicable to different groups, defined by advanced maternal age, ethnic groups and aspects of the pregnancy and medical history such as multiple pregnancy, diabetes and family history of Down's syndrome. We also considered whether there existed evidence of overestimation of test accuracy in studies evaluating risk equations in the derivation sample rather than in a separate validation sample.",18366788,0,"Human breast cancer cell lines contain stem-like cells that self-renew, give rise to phenotypically diverse progeny and survive chemotherapy.",The phenotypic and functional differences between cells that initiate human breast tumors (cancer stem cells) and those that comprise the tumor bulk are difficult to study using only primary tumor tissue.

The ORPK mouse arose through integration of a transgene into an intron of the Ift88 gene resulting in a hypomorphic allele (Ift88Tg737Rpw). The Ift88Tg737Rpw mutation impairs intraflagellar transport (IFT), a process required for assembly of motile and immotile cilia. Historically, the primary immotile cilium was thought to have minimal importance for human health; however, a rapidly expanding number of human disorders have now been attributed to ciliary defects. Importantly, many of these phenotypes are present and can be analyzed using the ORPK mouse. In this review, we highlight the research conducted using the OPRK mouse and the phenotypes shared with human cilia disorders. Furthermore, we describe an additional follicular dysplasia phenotype in the ORPK mouse, which alongside the ectodermal dysplasias seen in human Ellis-van Creveld and Sensenbrenner's syndromes, suggests an unappreciated role for primary cilia in the skin and hair follicle."

Previous studies suggested that FLT3/ITD mutation indicates a poor prognosis and that NPM1 mutation indicates a more favorable one, but these studies were often performed with selected patient populations. We investigated the clinical significance of these mutations at our institution with an unselected group of patients with newly diagnosed AML. This group included patients > or =60 years old and those with a poor performance status. Using polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analyses, we detected FLT3/ITD mutations in 12 patients (20.0%) and NPM1 mutations in 7 patients (11.7%) among a group of 60 patients. There was a nonsignificant trend for FLT3/ITD mutation to be associated with a poorer predicted overall survival (OS) probability in this population. In contrast, OS was significantly higher in patients with wild-type NPM1 than in patients with NPM1 mutation, both for all AML patients and for AML patients with a normal karyotype. In this general and unselected AML patient population, NPM1 mutation was not a prognostic indicator of a favorable outcome."

Three hundred thirty-two undergraduate students were administered the DPDI and measures of the aforementioned constructs. As predicted, the DPDI negatively correlated with all measures. Individuals classified with a depressive personality disorder had significantly higher scores on measures of hope, optimism, and QOL compared to a control group. Stepwise regression analysis indicated that optimism, QOL, and one component of hope significantly predicted DPDI scores, although more variance was accounted for in women than men. These findings are explained in light of Carver and Scheier's (2000) explanation of optimism and its relationship to hope. In sum, it appears that the construct validity of the DPDI is supported within an undergraduate sample."

Two hundred and thirty-one patients with Klebsiella pneumoniae monomicrobial bacteraemia at a hospital from 1 January to 31 December 2007 were prospectively enrolled. TTP <7 h (46 patients, 19.9%) was associated with a higher Pittsburg bacteraemia score (6.2 +/- 5.5 vs. 3.7 +/- 4.3, p 0.002), fewer non-fatal diseases by the McCabe classification (39.1% vs. 64.9%, p 0.002), a higher percentage of patients with liver cirrhosis, active malignancy, and chemotherapy within 3 months (28.3% vs. 11.9%, p 0.007; 28.3% vs. 14.6%, p 0.031; 23.9% vs. 5.4%, p <0.001), more primary bacteraemia (45.7% vs. 22.2%, p 0.002), and a higher 30-day mortality rate (47.8% vs. 21.1%, p <0.001). Risk factors for 30-day mortality in the univariate analysis included higher Pittsburg bacteraemia score (5.8 +/- 5.3 vs. 3.7 +/- 4.3, p 0.002), primary bacteraemia (41.0% vs. 21.8%, p 0.004), TTP <7 h (36.1% vs. 14.1%, p <0.001), and the presence of active malignancy (29.5% vs. 12.9%, p 0.004). In the multivariate analysis, higher Pittsburg bacteraemia score (OR 1.07; 95% CI 1.01-1.14), TTP <7 h (OR 2.46; 95% CI 1.20-5.05) and active malignancy (OR 2.21; 95% CI 1.03-4.73) were the significant factors associated with 30-day mortality. In the Kaplan-Meier survival curve, short TTP was significantly associated with mortality at all time-points after admission. TTP of blood cultures, interpreted with a cut-off point of <7 h, in patients with K. pneumoniae bacteraemia can provide useful prognostic information."

Oblimersen sodium is a bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide complementary to the first six codons of the open-reading frame of bcl-2 mRNA that can decrease transcription of Bcl-2 protein and increase myeloma cell susceptibility to cytotoxic agents. In this phase III randomised trial, we investigated in patients with relapsed/refractory myeloma whether addition of oblimersen to dexamethasone improved clinical outcomes vs. dexamethasone alone. Two hundred and twenty-four patients were randomised to receive either oblimersen/dexamethasone (N = 110) or dexamethasone alone (N = 114). The primary endpoint was time to tumor progression (TTP). Final results of this study demonstrated no significant differences between the two groups in TTP or objective response rate. The oblimersen/dexamethasone regimen was generally well tolerated with fatigue, fever and nausea, the most common adverse events reported."

To assess the effect of bosentan in SCD-PH, two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 16-week studies were initiated. Safety concerns are particularly relevant in SCD due to comorbid conditions. ASSET-1 and -2 enrolled patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and pulmonary venous hypertension (PH), respectively. Haemodynamics and 6-min walk distance (6MWD) were obtained at baseline and week 16. The studies were terminated due to slow site initiation and patient enrolment (n = 26). Bosentan appeared to be well tolerated. Although sample sizes were limited, in ASSET-1 at baseline, 6MWD correlated with cardiac output (CO; P = 0.006) with non-significant inverse correlations between 6MWD and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR; P = 0.07) and between 6MWD and right atrial pressure (P = 0.08). In ASSET-2 at baseline, there was a non-significant correlation between 6MWD and CO (P = 0.06). Due to limited sample sizes, efficacy endpoints were not analysed. However, in both studies, non-significant increases in CO were observed with bosentan compared to placebo. Similarly, non-significant decreases in PVR were observed with bosentan. Limited data in SCD-PH suggest that a low 6MWD predicts a low CO. Standard-dose bosentan appears to be well tolerated. Further investigation is warranted.

In vitro the PAN complex has been previously shown to have a stimulatory effect on the peptidase activities of the 20S core. By using gradient ultracentrifugation we found that, in cellular extracts, the two PAN proteins from Halobacterium do not form stable high-molecular-mass complexes. Only PAN B was found to associate transiently with the 20S proteasome, thus suggesting that the two PAN proteins are not functionally redundant. The PAN B-20S proteasome complexes associate in an ATP-dependent manner and are stabilized upon nucleotide binding. The two PAN proteins were immunodetected in cellular extracts as N-terminal-truncated polypeptides. RNA-mapping experiments and sequence analysis indicated that this process involved transcript heterogeneities and dual translational initiation mechanisms. Taken together, our results suggest that PAN N-terminal modifications and their intracellular dynamics of assembly/association may constitute important determinants of proteolysis regulation."

Investigation of sources of heterogeneity We planned to investigate the differences in diagnostic accuracy in subgroups defined by: age; ICH volume; timing of the index test(s) after symptom onset; CT technology (for example non-helical CT scanners, helical CT scanners, and multi-detector helical CT scanners) and MRI technology (for example MRI magnet strength and the type of angiographic technique used to image the arteries); the coverage of the brain that is investigated by CTA/MRA in each study (e.g. some users may only evaluate the region around the haematoma while others may choose to also evaluate vessels distant from the bleed); the number of arterial territories and orientations investigated by IADSA (e.g. the internal carotid artery territory, the external carotid artery territory, the vertebral artery territory, or all three); whether three-dimensional angiography was used; differences in the qualifications and experience of the radiologists reporting the index tests and reference standards.",20185164,0,Heparin versus prostacyclin in continuous hemodiafiltration for acute renal failure: effects on platelet function in the systemic circulation and across the filter.,"Continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) is the treatment of choice for critically-ill patients suffering from acute renal failure (ARF). One major problem of extracorporeal circuits is their thrombogenicity, which requires pharmacological blockade of primary (platelet-dependent) or secondary (plasmatic) haemostasis, increasing the patient's bleeding risk. Our study assessed platelet function during CVVHDF, comparing anticoagulant versus antiplatelet pharmacological strategies, commonly used to avoid circuit clotting. Twenty-three critically-ill patients with ARF, requiring CVVHDF were randomized to a prostacyclin analogue (PGI) or to unfractionated heparin (UFH). Ex vivo platelet function, assessed by optical aggregometry (OPA) induced by collagen or ADP, was studied in peripheral blood at baseline, 4 and 24 hrs after starting CVVHDF, and at 4 hrs within the circuit, before and after the filter (n=9). Coagulation was also monitored. PGI significantly inhibited ADP-induced OPA of peripheral platelets: maximal aggregation (Tmax) was reduced at 4 and 24 hrs by 20%, while collagen-induced Tmax was significantly reduced at 4 hrs only. In the UFH group, collagen-induced OPA in peripheral platelets was significantly inhibited: slopes of OPA tracings were decreased by 25%, lag time was prolonged by 22%, Tmax decreased by 10% already at 4 hrs. ADP-induced OPA showed a similar, but non-significant trend. UFH expectedly prolonged aPTT. In the UFH group, platelet responsiveness to collagen was significantly increased by 30% in post-filter versus pre-filter samples. This effect was blunted in the PGI group. UFH does not protect platelets from filter-induced activation and is associated with a reduced function of systemic platelets. Platelet-inhibiting agents might better prevent the activatory effect of the filter."

Because of difficulties in determining the effect of prolonged myocardial relaxation in vivo, we used a cardiovascular simulated computer model. The effect of myocardial relaxation, as assessed by tau (exponential time constant of relaxation), on pulmonary vein pressure (PVP) and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was investigated over a wide range of tau values (20-100 ms) and heart rate (60-140 beats/min) while keeping end-diastolic volume constant. Cardiac output was recorded over a wide range of tau and heart rate while keeping PVP constant. The effect of systolic intervals was investigated by changing time to end systole at the same heart rate. At a heart rate of 60 beats/min, increases in tau from a baseline to extreme value of 100 ms cause only a minor increase in PVP of 3 mmHg. In contrast, at 120 beats/min, the same increase in tau increases PVP by 23 mmHg. An increase in filling pressures at high heart rates was attributable to incomplete relaxation. The PVP-LVEDP gradient was not constant and increased with increasing tau and heart rate. Prolonged systolic intervals augmented the effects of tau on PVP. Impaired myocardial relaxation is an important determinant of PVP and cardiac output only during rapid heart rate and especially when combined with prolonged systolic intervals. These findings clarify the role of myocardial relaxation in the pathogenesis of elevated filling pressures characteristic of heart failure."

It is characterized by an aggressive clinical history, high rate of local relapse, and association with the basal epithelial-like subtype. Variations in breast cancer subtype and clinical outcome often exist across racial and ethnic lines. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the immunohistochemical and clinicopathologic characteristics of triple-negative breast carcinoma in women living in Vietnam with those from the United States. Invasive triple-negative breast carcinoma of patients from the 2 populations was characterized by tissue microarray for the expression of basal cytokeratins (CK5/6, CK7, CK14), luminal cytokeratins (CK8, CK18, CK19), and markers associated with the basal phenotype (cKit, epithelial growth factor receptor, P-cadherin, p53, and p63). Significant differences in expression between the 2 populations were not observed for the basal cytokeratins. However, epithelial growth factor receptor and P-cadherin, markers associated with the basal phenotype, were underexpressed in Vietnamese patients. Of the luminal cytokeratins, CK8 was overexpressed and CK18 was underexpressed in the Vietnamese women. Significant differences were also observed regarding the clinicopathologic characteristics. Triple-negative breast carcinoma in Vietnamese women was smaller and less likely to be grade III. In addition, it was more frequently of ductal histologic type and less often medullary or metaplastic. These differences in histology and marker expression suggest that triple-negative breast carcinoma has unique biological characteristics in women from Vietnam and the United States, and may follow a unique clinical course in each of the 2 populations."

In a survey of some 4500 people aged more than 40 years old in Japan, the prevalence of OAB was 12.4%. Even though OAB is prevalent and troublesome, many patients with OAB never seek medical help for their symptoms because of embarrassment and misconception about bladder control problems. Thus, it is important to broaden the actual knowledge about OAB among community-based people. We hope that this citizen joint symposium would help the participants to understand the useful information about OAB."

Experiments were performed at room temperature (22 degrees C). The firing rate of spontaneous activity was 61.7 +/- 1.6 beats/min (n = 12). Phorbol esters (100 nM and 1 microM) caused a negative chronotropic effect, and they inhibited the maximum rate of depolarization and the action potential amplitude. The action potential duration (at 50% repolarization) tended to decrease, and the maximum diastolic potential was unaffected. In whole-cell voltage-clamp experiments, both TPA and PDB inhibited the L-type Ca2+ current and the delayed rectifier K+ current. The fast time constant of the inactivation phase for the Ca2+ current was decreased, but the slow component was unaffected. In addition, PDB (100 nM) enhanced the T-type Ca2+ current, accompanied with an increase in its time constant. In contrast, 4-alpha-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate (PDD), an inactive analogue on PK-C, failed to produce significant changes. These results suggest that the PK-C stimulation induced by phorbol esters might affect the ionic currents and modulate the [Ca]i, resulting in regulation of the spontaneous activity of embryonic chick heart cells."

Drugs used can be difficult to detect (active products at low dosages, chemical instability), possess amnesic properties, and can be quickly cleared from body fluids. In case of long delay between the alleged crime and clinical examination, collection of blood or even urine can be of little value. This is the reason why this laboratory developed an original approach based on hair testing by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. To explore the detectability of a single absorption of bromazepam in hair, two volunteers (male and female) received a 6-mg dose. A strand of hair was sampled about one month after exposure and was cut into three segments of 2-cm long. After pulverization, 20 mg of hair was incubated overnight in a phosphate buffer (pH 8.4). The aqueous phase was extracted with 5 mL of a mixture of diethyl ether/methylene chloride (80:20) in the presence of diazepam-d5, which was used as internal standard (IS). Hair extract was separated on a XTerra MS C18 column using a gradient of acetonitrile and formate buffer. Detection was based on two daughter ions: transitions m/z 316.0 to 182.2 and 209.3 and m/z 290.1 to 154.1 and 198.2 for bromazepam and the IS, respectively. In the hair of the two subjects, bromazepam was detected in the proximal segment at 0.8 and 4.7 pg/mg, respectively. Hair analysis was applied to four authentic criminal cases. In the two first cases, bromazepam tested positive in the corresponding hair segment at 5.7, and 10.3 pg/mg. In another case, head hair was sampled 19 weeks after the alleged offense, and its length (< 4 cm) did not allow analysis of the corresponding period. However, 4.1 pg/mg of bromazepam was quantified in the victim's pubic hair. In these three cases, concentrations were consistent with a single exposure to bromazepam. In the last case, bromazepam was detected at 15 pg/mg in the segment corresponding to the period of the alleged offence but also in the range 2 to 7 pg/mg in the four other consecutive segments, making a single exposure statement difficult."

Water-loss dehydration was defined primarily as including everyone with either impending or current water-loss dehydration (including all those with serum osmolality ≥ 295 mOsm/kg as being dehydrated).",15286921,0,Differential accumulation and pigmenting ability of dietary carotenoids in colorful finches.,"Many animals develop bright red, orange, or yellow carotenoid pigmentation that they use to attract mates. Colorful carotenoid pigments are acquired from the diet and are either directly incorporated as integumentary colorants or metabolized into other forms before deposition. Because animals often obtain several different carotenoids from plant and animal food sources, it is possible that these pigments are accumulated at different levels in the body and may play unique roles in shaping the ultimate color expression of individuals. We studied patterns of carotenoid accumulation and integumentary pigmentation in two colorful finch species--the American goldfinch (Carduelis tristis) and the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata). Both species acquire two main hydroxycarotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin, from their seed diet but transform these into a series of metabolites that are used as colorful pigments in the plumage (goldfinches only) and beak (both species). We conducted a series of carotenoid-supplementation experiments to investigate the relative extent to which lutein and zeaxanthin are accumulated in blood and increase carotenoid coloration in feathers and bare parts. First, we supplemented the diets of both species with either lutein or zeaxanthin and measured plasma pigment status, feather carotenoid concentration (goldfinches only), and integumentary color. Zeaxanthin-supplemented males grew more colorful feathers and beaks than lutein-supplemented males, and in goldfinches incorporated a different ratio of carotenoids in feathers (favoring the accumulation of canary xanthophyll B). We also fed goldfinches different concentrations of a standard lutein-zeaxanthin mix and found that at physiologically normal and high concentrations, birds circulated proportionally more zeaxanthin over lutein than occurred in the diet. Collectively, these results demonstrate that zeaxanthin is preferentially accumulated in the body and serves as a more potent substrate for pigmentation than lutein in these finches."
CD011975,First trimester serum tests for Down's syndrome screening," The aim of this review was to estimate and compare the accuracy of first trimester serum markers for the detection of Down’s syndrome in the antenatal period, both as individual markers and as combinations of markers. Accuracy is described by the proportion of fetuses with Down’s syndrome detected by screening before birth (sensitivity or detection rate), and the proportion of women with a low risk (normal) screening test result who subsequently had a baby unaffected by Down's syndrome (specificity). Investigation of sources of heterogeneity We planned to investigate whether a uniform screening test is suitable for all women, or whether different screening methods are more applicable to different groups, defined by advanced maternal age, ethnic groups and aspects of the pregnancy and medical history such as multiple pregnancy, diabetes and family history of Down's syndrome. We also considered whether there existed evidence of overestimation of test accuracy in studies evaluating risk equations in the derivation sample rather than in a separate validation sample.",30377536,0,Overcoming barriers to use of child car seats in an urban Aboriginal community-formative evaluation of a program for Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services.,"Little is known about the barriers to use of child car seats in Australian Aboriginal communities, or the acceptability of programs to increase appropriate car seat use.

With the increase of resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxin in transgenic cotton plants, there is a need to develop an alternative control approach that can be used in combination with Bt transgenic crops as part of resistance management strategies. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a non-coding small RNA family (18-25 nt), play crucial roles in various biological processes and over-expression of miRNAs has been shown to interfere with the normal development of insects. In this study, we identified 127 conserved miRNAs in S. exigua by using small RNA deep sequencing technology. From this, we tested the effects of 11 miRNAs on larval development. We found three miRNAs, Sex-miR-10-1a, Sex-miR-4924, and Sex-miR-9, to be differentially expressed during larval stages of S. exigua. Oral feeding experiments using synthetic miRNA mimics of Sex-miR-10-1a, Sex-miR-4924, and Sex-miR-9 resulted in suppressed growth of S. exigua and mortality. Over-expression of Sex-miR-4924 caused a significant reduction in the expression level of chitinase 1 and caused abortive molting in the insects. Therefore, we demonstrated a novel approach of using miRNA mimics to control S. exigua development."
CD009925,Second trimester serum tests for Down's Syndrome screening,"The aim of this review was to estimate and compare the accuracy of second trimester serum markers for the detection of Down’s syndrome in the antenatal period, both as individual markers and as combinations of markers. Accuracy is described by the proportion of fetuses with Down’s syndrome detected by screening before birth (sensitivity or detection rate) and the proportion of women with a low risk (normal) screening test result who subsequently had a baby unaffected by Down's syndrome (specificity). We grouped our analyses to focus on investigating the value of adding increasing numbers of markers (comparing single, dual, triple and quadruple tests), and of including Inhibin A, the most recent routine addition to serum marker combinations. Investigation of sources of heterogeneity We investigated whether a uniform screening test is suitable for all women, or whether different screening methods are more applicable to different groups, defined by advanced maternal age, ethnic groups and aspects of the pregnancy and medical history such as multiple pregnancy, diabetes and family history of Down's syndrome. We also considered whether there existed evidence of overestimation of test accuracy in studies evaluating risk equations in the derivation sample rather than in a separate validation sample.",111634,0,Influence of increasing carbohydrate intake on glucose kinetics in injured patients.,"The metabolic and hormonal effect of glucose loads, ranging from 125 to 504 g/70 kg/day, were studied in severely injured patients. There was little or no correlation of glucose intake with nitrogen balance, plasma glucose, fatty acid concentrations, or epinephrine excretion. Increased norepinephrine excretion correlated with and may have resulted from increased glucose intake. Serum glucagon concentrations averaged 320 pg/ml and were not depressed by glucose intake. Insulin concentrations rose with glucose intake but were low for the level of plasma glucose. Glucose oxidation and non-oxidative metabolism, including glycogen deposition, correlated well with glucose intake. Gluconeogenesis from alanine was much higher than normal but was completely suppressed at very high intakes. The data imply that cycling of glucose, with glycerol, glycogen, or both, increased with increasing glucose intake."

The records of 27 such ALS ventilator users with less than 15 minutes of ventilator-free breathing time for a mean +/- standard deviation of 23.7 +/- 20.3 months (range, 1 to 65) were reviewed. All patients underwent measurements of vital capacity (VC), maximum insufflation capacity (MIC), MIC VC difference, forced expiratory volumes, and peak cough expiratory flows (PCEF) every 1 to 6 months, depending on rate of disease progression, until requiring 24-hour ventilatory support. The ability to generate assisted PCEF in excess of 3L/sec and the ability to hold an insufflation deeper than the VC were associated with the capacity to prolong survival by methods other than tracheostomy, whereas the extent of decrease in VC and autonomous breathing ability were not. Because the PCEF and MIC VC difference correlate with bulbar muscle function, it can be concluded that the ability to use 24-hour ventilatory support by noninvasive means is a function of residual bulbar muscle strength and is independent of VC or the extent of need for ventilatory support. Properly equipped and trained, some ALS patients can use noninvasive respiratory muscle aids to delay or eliminate the need for tracheostomy."

The TSH responses were decreased in all of these affective disorders compared to those found in 10 patients with reactive depression, 5 with reactive paranoid psychosis, 14 with neurotic depression, and 60 controls. The decrease of the TSH response in manics could not be accounted for by the effects of neuroleptic drugs. The TSH response in the groups with reactive depression, reactive paranoid psychosis, and neurotic depression, respectively, did not differ significantly from that found in controls. With the exception of a decrease in serum T3 level and free T3 index in the manics, no significant differences in serum T3 level or in free T3 and T4 indexes were found between the groups. Changes found in serum T4 level were due to changes in the thyroxine-binding proteins."

The analysis of the initial parts of the dependences of the hydrodynamic radius of protein aggregates on time shows that in the presence of alpha-crystallin or GroEL the kinetic regime of GAPDH aggregation is changed from the regime of diffusion-limited cluster-cluster aggregation to the regime of reaction-limited cluster-cluster aggregation, wherein the sticking probability for the colliding particles becomes lower the unity. In contrast to alpha-crystallin, GroEL does not interfere with formation of the start aggregates which include denatured GAPDH molecules. On the basis of the analytical ultracentrifugation data the conclusion has been made that the products of dissociation of GAPDH and alpha-crystallin or GroEL play an important role in the interactions of GAPDH and chaperones at elevated temperatures."

Prior therapy included surgical resection of primary tumor (84 patients), radiotheapy (21 patients), chemotherapy (33 patients). Thirteen patients received prior bleomycin and vincristine or vinblastine. Of 80 evaluable patients 51 achieved complete response (CR) and 26 achieved partial response (PR), for an overall response rate 96.5%. There was no significant difference in response rates or survival with respect to prior therapy, sites of metastatic lesions, and tumor histology. The median survival time was not reached in an observation period of 44+ months. Sixty patients were alive 11+--44+ months, and 57 of these were free of disease. Thirty-two of the 60 patients (53%) had a survival time greater than 20 months.

These cells are therefore potential targets for innovative anticancer therapies. However, the absence of bona fide cancer stem cell lines is a real problem for the development of such approaches. Since teratocarcinoma cells are totipotent stem cells with a high degree of malignancy, we used them as a model of cancer stem cells in order to evaluate the anticancer chemopreventive activity of red wine polyphenols (RWPs) and to determine the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. We therefore investigated the effects of RWPs on the embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell line P19 which was grown in the same culture conditions as the most appropriate normal cell line counterpart, the pluripotent embryonic fibroblast cell line NIH/3T3. The present study indicates that RWPs selectively inhibited the proliferation of P19 EC cells and induced G1 cell cycle arrest in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, RWPs treatment specifically triggered apoptosis of P19 EC cells in association with a dramatic upregulation of the tumor suppressor gene p53 and caspase-3 activation. Our findings suggest that the chemopreventive activity of RWPs on tumor initiation and development is related to a growth inhibition and a p53-dependent induction of apoptosis in teratocarcinoma cells. In addition, this study also shows that the EC cell line is a convenient source for studying the responses of cancer stem cells to new potential anticancer agents."

In this system, the monomer and initiating species in toluene (organic phase) and the catalyst complexes in water (aqueous phase) are simply mixed under stirring at room temperature. The trace catalyst complexes transfer into the organic phase via diffusion to trigger ICAR ATRP of MMA with ppm level catalyst content once the system is heated to the polymerization temperature (75 °C). It is found that well-defined PMMA with controlled molecular weights and narrow molecular weight distributions can be obtained easily. Furthermore, the polymerization can be conducted in the presence of limited amounts of air without using tedious degassed procedures. After cooling to room temperature, the upper organic phase is decanted and the lower aqueous phase is reused for another 10 recycling turnovers with ultra low loss of catalyst and ligand loading. At the same time, all the recycled catalyst complexes retain nearly perfect catalytic activity and controllability, indicating a facile and economical strategy for catalyst removal and recycling. "

We retrospectively examined microbiologically confirmed cases of enteric fever in adult returned travellers over an 18-year period presenting to two tertiary referral hospitals in Melbourne, Australia. There were 59 cases of Salmonella typhi infection, 43 cases of S. paratyphi A infection and two cases of S. paratyphi B infection. Most patients reported recent travel to India (36%) or Indonesia (29%). NAR isolates were commonly encountered (41% of all isolates), particularly from India (75%), Pakistan (80%) and Bangladesh (60%). The number of NAR isolates increased progressively after 2003. Patients with NAR isolates had prolonged mean fever clearance time (5.6 vs. 3.3 days, P = 0.03) and prolonged hospital stay (7.9 vs. 5.7 days, P = 0.02) compared to non-resistant isolates. This represents the largest report of NAR enteric fever in returned travellers. NAR isolates predominate in cases of enteric fever from South Asia and result in prolonged fever clearance time and hospital stay. Empiric therapy with alternative antibiotics such as ceftriaxone or azithromycin should be considered in patients with suspected enteric fever from this region."

However, the amount of donor islet tissue is limited, therefore, multiple approaches are being explored to generate insulin-producing cells in vitro. Some promising results have been obtained using mouse and human stem cells and progenitor cells [Soria et al., From stem cells to beta cells: new strategies in cell therapy of diabetes mellitus, Diabetologia. 4 (2001) 407-415; Lechner et al., Stem/progenitor cells derived from adult tissues: potential for the treatment of diabetes mellitus, Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab. 284 (2003) 259-266; Bonner-Weir et al., In vitro cultivation of human islets from expanded ductal tissue, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 97 (2000) 7999-8004; Assady et al., Insulin production by human embryonic stem cells, 50 (2001) Diabetes 1691-1697]. However, the efficiency of obtaining populations with high numbers of differentiated cells has been poor. In order to improve the efficiency of producing and selecting insulin-producing cells from undifferentiated cells, we have designed a novel beta-cell specific and glucose responsive promoter system designated pGL3.hINS-363 3x. This artificial promoter system exhibits significant luciferase activity not only in insulin-producing MIN6 m9 cells but also in isolated human islets. The pGL3.hINS-363 3x construct shows no activity in non-insulin-producing cells in low glucose conditions (2 mM glucose) but demonstrates significant activity and beta-cell specificity in high glucose conditions (16 mM glucose). Furthermore, pGL3.hINS-363 3x shows significant promoter activity in differentiated AR42J cells that can produce insulin after activin A and betacellulin treatment. Here, we describe a novel beta-cell specific and glucose responsive artificial promoter system designed for analyzing and sorting beta-like insulin-producing cells that have differentiated from stem cells or other progenitor cells."

Previously, we showed that an eight hydrophobic motif amino acid substitution in Domain I did not affect the antibody inducing capacity of the Cry1A toxins, on the contrary, it was enhanced after intranasal immunization. In addition, Cry1A mutants (carrying a substitution of a motif from fragment B of diphtheria toxin into the structurally similar hydrophobic alpha-helix 7 motif of Cry1A toxins) were able to modulate the ratio of IgG subclasses, IgG1/IgG2a. However, the capacity of these toxins to induce cellular immune response has not been studied. Thus, in this work, we investigated the cytokine profile induced after in vitro stimulation with the toxins, in spleen cell cultures from unprimed mice, and intranasally primed mice, with either wild-type Cry1Aa or with mutant toxin Cry1Aa8. Spleen cells from unprimed mice stimulated with Cry1Aa produced very low levels of Th1 (IFN-gamma, IL-12p70) and Th2 type cytokines (IL-10, IL-4), whereas immunization with Cry1Aa8 toxin led to higher production of these cytokines. Restimulation of spleen cells from primed mice with the Cry1Aa induced the production of significant levels of IL-12p70 whereas with Cry1Aa8, IFN-gamma production was stimulated. Interestingly, we found that the capacity of Cry1A toxins to induce cytokine production by lymphocytes was inhibited by N-acetylgalactosamine. Altogether these data demonstrate the immunogenic properties of Cry1A toxins and show that amino acid substitution in Domain I principally affects its ability to induce Th1 cytokines in lymphocytes."

The PAH desorption rate constants were measured using off-line HPLC monitoring of their concentrations in soot samples as a function of desorption time. The following Arrhenius expressions were determined for the desorption rate constants of the soot-bound PAHs studied: k(des) = 8.4 x 10(15) exp[-(129.7 +/- 4.4)/RT], 1.0 x 10(16) exp[-(130.6 +/- 6.1)/RT], 1.1 x 10(16) exp[-(131.6 +/- 3.2)/RT], 1.0 x 10(16) exp[-(128.0 +/- 3.9)/RT], and 1.4 x 10(16) exp[-(134.2 +/- 10.7)/RT] (k(des) are in s(-1) and activation energies in kJ mol(-1)) for BghiP, IdP, Antha, DBahA, and DBaeP, respectively. Analysis of the present and previous experimental data showed that PAH-soot binding energies linearly correlate with the number of PAH carbon atoms. The present data and those from previous studies are discussed in the frame of the existing theoretical gas-to-particle partitioning model."

The prepared carbon nanotube/layered double hydroxide nanocomposite was successfully prepared and deposited on a stainless-steel wire for the fabrication of the solid-phase microextraction fiber. The fiber was evaluated for the extraction of phenolic compounds from water samples. Analytical merits of the method, under optimum conditions (extraction temperature: 75°C, extraction time: 30 min, desorption time: 2 min, desorption temperature 260°C, salt concentration: 10% w/v) are 0.01-300 ng/mL for the linear dynamic range and 0.005-0.08 for the limit of detection. In optimum conditions, the repeatability for one fiber (n = 3), expressed as relative standard deviation, was between 6.5 and 9.9% for the phenolic compounds. "

Negative feedback regulation of ALAS-1 by the end product heme is well documented and provides the foundation for heme treatment of acute porphyrias, a group of diseases caused by genetic defects in the heme biosynthesis pathway and exacerbated by controlled up-regulation of ALAS-1. Heme is known to affect ALAS-1 activity by repressing gene transcription, accelerating mRNA degradation, and impeding pre-ALAS-1 mitochondrial translocation. In the current study, we examined the effect of heme on the rate of mature ALAS-1 protein turnover in human cells and tissues and explored the mediator involved in this new regulatory mechanism. We found that heme and other metalloporphyrins such as CoPP and CrPP decreased mitochondrial ALAS-1 protein through proteolysis. This degradative effect cannot be emulated by iron or free protoporphyrin, two major chemical components of the heme ring, and is independent of oxidative stress. Down-regulating the activity of mitochondrial LONP1, an ATP-dependent protease that controls the selective turnover of mitochondrial matrix proteins, with potent inhibitors and specific siRNA diminished the negative effect of heme on mitochondrial ALAS-1. Therefore, our data support the existence of a conserved heme feedback regulatory mechanism that functions on the mature form of ALAS-1 protein through the activity of a mitochondrial proteolytic system."

Dexmethylphenidate contains the d-threo-enantiomer of methylphenidate. Dexmethylphenidate XR capsules have a bimodal release profile, which mimics two doses of dexmethylphenidate immediate release (IR) given 4 hours apart, and allows once-daily administration. Once-daily dexmethylphenidate XR was effective and generally well tolerated in the treatment of ADHD in children, adolescents and adults in placebo-controlled trials. Improvements in ADHD symptoms were significantly greater for dexmethylphenidate XR versus placebo throughout the day, from as early as 0.5 hours after drug administration up to 11-12 hours after administration. Furthermore, dexmethylphenidate XR showed greater efficacy than osmotic release oral system (OROS) methylphenidate over the first half of the laboratory classroom day in crossover trials; however, assessments late in the day (10-12 hours post-dose) favoured OROS methylphenidate. The once-daily administration regimen with dexmethylphenidate XR avoids the need for a midday dose to be administered at school; administration options are extended in that the contents of the dexmethylphenidate XR capsule can be sprinkled on apple sauce for patients unable to swallow the capsule whole. Although dexmethylphenidate XR is a controlled substance in the US, this formulation appears to have a low risk of abuse or misuse. Thus, dexmethylphenidate XR extends the range of first-line pharmacological treatment options for children, adolescents or adults with ADHD, particularly for patients who require a rapid onset and prolonged duration of action, including children who require a reduction in ADHD symptoms throughout the school day."

Previous studies of the effect of limb length on the energetic cost of locomotion have reported no relationship; however, limb length could have accounted for as much as 19% of the variation in cost and gone undetected (Steudel and Beattie, 1995; Steudel, 1994, 1996). Kramer (1999) and Kramer and Eck (2000) have recently used a theoretical model to predict the effect of the shorter limbs of early hominids, concluding that the shorter limbs may actually have been energetically advantageous. Here, we took an experimental approach. Twenty-one human subjects, of varying limb lengths, walked on a treadmill at 2.6, 2.8, 3.0 and 3.2m.p.h., while their expired gases were analyzed. The subjects walked for 12 minutes at each speed and their rates of oxygen consumption (VO2) over four minutes were averaged to estimate VO2. We also measured each subject's height, weight and lower limb length. Lean body mass and % fat were determined using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. ANCOVA with total VO2 at either speed as the dependent variable and total lean mass, % fat and lower limb length as covariates resulted in all three covariates having a significant positive effect on VO2 at p<0.01. Subjects with relatively longer lower limbs had lower locomotor costs. Thus the short lower limbs characteristic of some hominid taxa would have resulted in more costly locomotion, barring some physiological anomaly. The magnitude of this effect is substantial; Neanderthals are estimated to have had locomotor costs 30% greater than those of contemporary anatomically modern humans. By contrast the increase in lower limb length seen in H. erectus would have mitigated the increase in locomotor costs produced by the increase in body size."
CD008201,Interventions for implementation of thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized patients at risk for venous thromboembolism,"  The objective of this review was to assess the effects of system‐wide interventions, designed to increase the implementation of thromboprophylaxis, decrease the incidence of VTE in hospitalized adult medical and surgical patients at risk for VTE, or both, focusing on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) only.

Although we want to identify whether 'early forms of Alzheimer's disease dementia' are present at the moment of examination, there is no reference standard to make a final diagnosis of early ADD. Follow-up is therefore needed to reconstruct what was going on at the time of the index examination. In this context, it is clear that the duration of follow-up becomes critical, i.e. sufficiently long to capture the natural course of conversion.",16927878,0,Effect of Commiphora molmol on Bithynia connollyi with special reference to their morphology and medical importance.,"Morphological studies on B. connollyi dealt with the shell description, concerning colour, number of whorls, measurements, the correlation coefficient between shell shape and thickness, weight, length and width. Electrophoretic studies were carried out on snail's foot. Examination of B. connollyi showed a lot of gymnocephalus cercariae of liver fluke, Opisthorchis sp. Commiphora mohmol (Myrrh) has molluscicidal effect on B. connollyi at concentration (80 ppm) after 72 hr exposure. The mortality rate increased with the increasing the exposure time (death 100% at 72 hr. with 80 ppm & death 100% at 96 hr. with 40 ppm). Based on safety to man, animals and environment, C. molmol is highly recommended as a cheap herbal molluscicide."

Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) from ovarian follicles had significantly lower levels of precursor and mature miR-378 in cumulus cells surrounding metaphase II (MII) oocytes than cumulus cells surrounding germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes, suggesting a possible role of miR-378 during COC maturation. Overexpression of miR-378 in cumulus cells impaired expansion and decreased expression of genes associated with expansion (HAS2, PTGS2) and oocyte maturation (CX43, ADAMTS1, PGR). Cumulus cell expression of miR-378 also suppressed oocyte progression from the GV to MII stage (from 54 ± 2.7 to 31 ± 5.1%), accompanied by a decrease of growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9), bone morphogenetic protein 15 (BMP15), zona pellucida 3 (ZP3), and CX37 in the oocytes. Subsequent in vitro fertilization resulted in fewer oocytes from COCs overexpressing miR-378 reaching the blastocyst stage (7.3 ± 0.7 vs. 16.6 ± 0.5%). miR-378 knockdown led to increased cumulus expansion and oocyte progression to MII, confirming a specific effect of miR-378 in suppressing COC maturation. Aromatase (CYP19A1) expression in cumulus cells was also inhibited by miR-378, leading to a significant decrease in estradiol production. The addition of estradiol to IVM culture medium reversed the effect of miR-378 on cumulus expansion and oocyte meiotic progression, suggesting that decreased estradiol production via suppression of aromatase may be one of the mechanisms by which miR-378 regulates the maturation of COCs. Our data suggest that miR-378 alters gene expression and function in cumulus cells and influences oocyte maturation, possibly via oocyte-cumulus interaction and paracrine regulation. "
CD011975,First trimester serum tests for Down's syndrome screening," The aim of this review was to estimate and compare the accuracy of first trimester serum markers for the detection of Down’s syndrome in the antenatal period, both as individual markers and as combinations of markers. Accuracy is described by the proportion of fetuses with Down’s syndrome detected by screening before birth (sensitivity or detection rate), and the proportion of women with a low risk (normal) screening test result who subsequently had a baby unaffected by Down's syndrome (specificity). Investigation of sources of heterogeneity We planned to investigate whether a uniform screening test is suitable for all women, or whether different screening methods are more applicable to different groups, defined by advanced maternal age, ethnic groups and aspects of the pregnancy and medical history such as multiple pregnancy, diabetes and family history of Down's syndrome. We also considered whether there existed evidence of overestimation of test accuracy in studies evaluating risk equations in the derivation sample rather than in a separate validation sample.",18367118,0,Sexual intimacy in heterosexual couples after prostate cancer treatment: What we know and what we still need to learn.,"Receiving a diagnosis of and treatment for prostate cancer often results in significant physical side-effects and associated psychosocial stressors that can interfere with the experience of sexual intimacy for couples. Despite the fact that prostate cancer affects mainly older men, the maintenance of sexual intimacy is an important issue to consider, as the majority of older adults continue to value, engage in, and enjoy sexual activity throughout their lives. While the current research identifies the challenges that many men face, little is known about the strategies that couples use to successfully maintain sexual intimacy after prostate cancer treatment. In this review article, the existing literature on sexual intimacy after prostate cancer is reviewed, a critical analysis of current limitations in our knowledge and understanding is provided, and directions for further research are suggested."

Two commonly made simplifying assumptions in the basic mathematics of pulse oximetry, however, strongly influence the accuracy of the measurement if not accounted for in the sensor's design. Accurate oximeter performance requires a good overlap in light penetration at the wavelengths utilized in order to minimize the effects of tissue heterogeneity. Furthermore, path length changes arising from variations in tissue absorbance must be balanced at the two wavelengths or else calibration bias may result. The effects of light scattering within the tissue need to be considered over the range of oxygen saturation in which best operation of the system is desired. For oximeters designed to monitor air-breathing patients at high saturation, the conventional choice of emitter wavelengths optimizes both accuracy and measurement sensitivity. For the lower oxygen saturations typical in the fetus during labor, numerical modeling suggests that significantly better accuracy can be expected when a far red and near infrared emitter pair are used, even though the saturation measurement sensitivity is somewhat reduced."

The aims of this study were to establish whether aging reduces speech intelligibility for listeners with normal audiograms, and, if so, to assess the relative contributions of auditory temporal and cognitive processing. Twenty-one older normal-hearing (ONH; 60-79 years) participants with bilateral audiometric thresholds ≤ 20 dB HL at 0.125-6 kHz were matched to nine young (YNH; 18-27 years) participants in terms of mean audiograms, years of education, and performance IQ. Measures included: (1) identification of consonants in quiet and in noise that was unmodulated or modulated at 5 or 80 Hz; (2) identification of sentences in quiet and in co-located or spatially separated two-talker babble; (3) detection of modulation of the temporal envelope (TE) at frequencies 5-180 Hz; (4) monaural and binaural sensitivity to temporal fine structure (TFS); (5) various cognitive tests. Speech identification was worse for ONH than YNH participants in all types of background. This deficit was not reflected in self-ratings of hearing ability. Modulation masking release (the improvement in speech identification obtained by amplitude modulating a noise background) and spatial masking release (the benefit obtained from spatially separating masker and target speech) were not affected by age. Sensitivity to TE and TFS was lower for ONH than YNH participants, and was correlated positively with speech-in-noise (SiN) identification. Many cognitive abilities were lower for ONH than YNH participants, and generally were correlated positively with SiN identification scores. The best predictors of the intelligibility of SiN were composite measures of cognition and TFS sensitivity. These results suggest that declines in speech perception in older persons are partly caused by cognitive and perceptual changes separate from age-related changes in audiometric sensitivity. "

We report here a male patient who injured his left elbow while arm wrestling. Ultrasonography showed a medial collateral ligament tear. We assessed both elbows using ultrasonography at his 3-year follow-up visit. Dynamic ultrasonography showed a decreased gap at the ulnotrochlear joint space in his left elbow. A medial collateral ligament tear in his right elbow was also evident using ultrasonography. This case report shows the advantages of ultrasonography, especially dynamic ultrasonography, in the evaluation of elbow injury. Ultrasonography provides more information than valgus stress radiography, arthrography, and magnetic resonance imaging in the assessment of medial collateral ligament injury. In addition, the contralateral side can readily be assessed for comparison during ultrasonography. "

Secondary objectives To provide the tools to calculate EUS diagnostic accuracy measures based on pre-test information, such as gastric cancer T-stage and N-stage prevalence (Bayes nomograms). To assess whether EUS performs differently in different subgroups of patients identified by the following parameters: year of publication, country (Western versus Eastern), EUS technical features (radial versus linear array; ultrasound frequency (MHz)), definition of target condition (for N-stage: lymph node morphology versus size), gastric tumor site (any site versus cardia region only) and prevalence of target condition.",21668187,0,Internal electron diffraction from atomically ordered subsurface nanostructures in metals.,"We demonstrate that a part of interface at a subsurface nanocavity in Cu(110) can efficiently induce electron scattering back to the surface even if it is inclined with respect to the surface, if the condition for electron diffraction is fulfilled. This backscattering induces oscillations of electron local density of states at the surface versus electron energy. In agreement with our model calculations, the diffraction is assigned to a specific atomic structure at the interface, and is found to be significantly enhanced by focussing of electron waves for propagation along the [110] direction."

Aging is associated with a higher incidence of falls, and in the elderly falls may occur particularly during the adaptation to postural change. This study evaluated the cerebrovascular adaptation to postural change in 15 healthy younger (YNG) vs. 15 older (OLD) subjects by recordings of the near-infrared spectroscopy-determined cerebral oxygenation (cO₂Hb) and the transcranial Doppler-determined mean middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCA V(mean)). In OLD (59 (52-65) years) vs. YNG (29 (27-33) years), the initial postural decline in mean arterial pressure (-52 ± 3% vs. -67 ± 3%), cO₂Hb (-3.4 ± 2.5 μmoll(-1) vs. -5.3 ± 1.7 μmoll(-1)) and MCA V(mean) (-16 ± 4% vs. -29 ± 3%) was smaller. The decline in MCA V(mean) was related to the reduction in MAP. During prolonged orthostatic stress, the decline in MCA V(mean)and cO(2)Hb in OLD remained smaller. We conclude that with healthy aging the postural reduction in cerebral perfusion becomes less prominent."

The first step in developing molecular tools for a whole genome scan was the characterization of a set of microsatellite markers, termed minimal screening set 1 (MSS1), that provided an estimated coverage of 10 cM. A limiting factor in use of the MSS1 is not all of the 172 MSS1 markers have been localized to specific chromosomes. Seventy-five of the markers were positioned on a total of 15 chromosomes with the original publication of the MSS1.

Therefore, embodiment provides an explanation to the mental representation and linguistic expression of concepts. Among the first, we find multimodal conceptual structures, like image schemas, which are schematic representations of embodied experiences resulting from our conceptualization of the surrounding environment (Tercedor Sánchez et al. in J Spec Transl 18:187-205, 2012). Furthermore, the way we interact with the environment and its objects is dynamic and configures how we refer to concepts both by means of images and lexicalizations. In this article, we investigate how image schemas underlie verbal and visual representations. They both evoke concepts based on exteroception, interoception and proprioception which can be lexicalized through language. More specifically, we study (1) a multimodal corpus of medical texts to examine how image schemas lexicalize in the language of medicine to represent specialized concepts and (2) medical pictures to explore the depiction of image-schematic concepts, in order to account for the verbal and visual representation of embodied concepts. We explore the concept PAIN, a sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, using corpus analysis tools (Sketch Engine) to extract information about the lexicalization of underlying image schemas in definitions and defining contexts. Then, we use the image schemas behind medical concepts to consistently select images which depict our experience of pain and the way we understand it. Finally, such lexicalizations and visualizations will help us assess how we refer to PAIN both verbally and visually. "

In a second step the experimental combination effects have to be compared to the expected ones in order to classify the combination as synergistic or antagonistic. Adopting the response surface methodology, a new procedure for the calculation of zero interaction response surfaces which can be applied both to various criteria for defining zero interaction and to various types of dose-response relations is proposed.

FLC proteinuria was suspected based on identification of a 22- to 27-kDa band by sodium dodecyl sulfate-agarose gel electrophoresis (SDS-AGE) and later confirmed by immunofixation electrophoresis. SDS-AGE identified an isolated band of 22-27 kDa in 8 dogs, whereas the remaining 3 had a 22- to 27-kDa band and an additional band of 67-72 kDa. The median urine protein-to-urine creatinine ratio was 0.37 (range, 0.11-2.24) and increased ratios were found in 6 dogs (54.5%) (reference value, <0.7). All dogs underwent histologic examination of renal percutaneous biopsy specimens and determination of serum creatinine and urea concentrations. Tissue samples for light microscopy were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, Goldners trichrome, and methenamine silver. In the study group, the glomerular tufts, mesangium, tubulointerstitium, and vessels appeared unaffected. The median serum creatinine concentration in these 11 dogs was 1.3 mg/dL (range, 0.8-1.5 mg/dL; reference range, 0.6-1.5 mg/dL), whereas the concentration for urea was 28 mg/dL (range, 22-52 mg/dL; reference range, 20-50 mg/dL). All dogs had normal renal morphology and had normal serum creatinine and urea concentrations, suggesting that immunoglobulin FLC may be detected in the urine of dogs exposed to L. infantum, E. canis, and B. canis without any apparent structural or functional renal derangement."

The purpose of the survey was to obtain information relative to the inclusion of chiropractic into future health planning to be conducted by the HSA. The survey was divided into a ""Physicians Survey"" obtaining information on location, office hours, gross income, total patient visits and type of practice of the doctor, and a ""Patient Survey"" obtaining information on age, sex, ethnic origin, residence, and payment source of the patients. Clinical information on initial complaints, diagnoses, treatment, referrals, and amount of care was also obtained. It was found that chiropractors work an average of 31.7 hours per week with a gross annual income of $74,750.00 (1979). The male-female distribution of patients was equal and the average patient age was 43.4 years. Anglocaucasian category comprised 80.2% of the patient sample. Nearly 50% of all chiropractic patients pay for services rendered out of their own pocket. Of the primary diagnosis, 81.3% related to the spine. The study concludes that the practice of chiropractic in Dade County is very similar to the practice of chiropractic in general."

Depending on the heritability of the underlying processes that determine net ROS levels, this may influence ageing per se and its evolutionary direction and rate of change. In order to understand the inheritance and evolution of net ROS levels in free-ranging lizards, we used flow cytometry together with ROS-sensitive fluorogenic probes to measure ROS in lizard blood cells. We measured basal levels of (i) non-specific ROS (superoxide, singlet oxygen, H2O2 and peroxynitrite), (ii) superoxide specifically and (iii) superoxide after CCCP treatment, which elevated ROS production in the mitochondria. The cumulative level of non-specific ROS was higher in adults than juveniles and superoxide level showed high heritability and variability among families. We suggest that the evolution of ROS dynamics may be ROS species specific and perhaps depend on the relative degree of uni- or biparental inheritance of ROS main regulatory pathways."

This is due to the relationship between attenuation and absorption coefficient becoming nonlinear; hence, the use of the Lambert-Beer law becomes invalid. It has previously been shown that application of polarization techniques can reduce these effects, resulting in a more linear relationship. Here we quantify the impact of this improvement on measurement of the ratio of concentrations for two general absorbing species and show that measurement using polarization-maintaining light is more accurate. This is performed using a generalized version of theory previously dependent on selection of isosbestic wavelengths. For the absorbing species and geometries considered here, the mean error on the estimation of absorber concentration ratio is 18.2% for the case of detection without polarization discrimination. When polarization-maintaining light is extracted, mean errors of 1.2% and 5.1% are achieved for linear and circular polarizations, respectively. The improvement provided by the polarization techniques is observed regardless of the illuminating wavelengths but is achieved at the expense of a reduced signal-to-noise ratio. Taking this into account, for the detection scheme considered with a detector well capacity of 4 x 10(5) electrons the improvement provided by linear polarization-maintaining light is reduced to a factor of 3.6 and for circular polarizations a factor of 2.2."

However, here we show that the thyroid hormone T(3) directly stimulates feeding at the level of the hypothalamus. Peripheral administration of T(3) doubled food intake in ad libitum-fed rats over 2 h and induced expression of the immediate early gene, early growth response-1, in the hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus (VMN), whereas maintaining plasma-free T(3) levels within the normal range. T(3)-induced feeding occurred without altering energy expenditure or locomotion. Injection of T(3) directly into the VMN produced a 4-fold increase in food intake in the first hour. The majority of T(3) in the brain is reported to be produced by tissue-specific conversion of T(4) to T(3) by the enzyme type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (D2). Hypothalamic D2 mRNA expression showed a diurnal variation, with a peak in the nocturnal feeding phase. Hypothalamic D2 mRNA levels also increased after a 12- and 24-h fast, suggesting that local production of T(3) may play a role in this T(3) feeding circuit. Thus, we propose a novel hypothalamic feeding circuit in which T(3), from the peripheral circulation or produced by local conversion, stimulates food intake via the VMN."

Veratrine stimulated phosphoinositide breakdown with an EC50 value of 5 microM. The stimulation produced by 20 microM veratrine was blocked completely by (+)-bupivacaine (IC50 7.6 microM [mean of three separate experimental series]), (-)-bupivacaine (IC50 7.3 microM), lidocaine (IC50 34 microM), etidocaine (IC50 3.4 microM), tetracaine (IC50 approximately 2 microM), and prilocaine (IC50 110 microM). Phosphoinositide breakdown responses to ouabain (100-1000 microM) and K+ (50 mM) were only partially blocked by (+)-bupivacaine, and the responses to monensin (100 and 1000 microM) and noradrenaline (30 microM) were not blocked at all by this drug. Nifedipine produced no significant effects on the phosphoinositide response to 10 microM veratrine. It is concluded that in pulse label experiments using rat cerebral cortical miniprisms, local anesthetics in general, and (+)-bupivacaine in particular, block the phosphoinositide response to veratrine with a high degree of specificity. This system may be useful as a relatively simple and quantitative assay for drug effects on Na(+)-channels."

We aimed to identify source(s) and risk factors for Cryptosporidium infection in university persons symptomatic between 21 January and 14 April 2013. Sixty-four (79%) students from a cohort of 81 fourth-year veterinary students completed questionnaires, identifying 13 cases; four were Cryptosporidium parvum GP60 subtype IIaA16G1R1b, two were IIdA24G1, seven did not submit stool samples. Thirteen cases attended the university's field clinic before symptom onset (13/37 attendees, 35%); 11 visited at least one of four farms where students recalled seeing calves with diarrhoea. C. parvum subtype IIaA16G1R1b was identified in calves at one of the farms. Entering pens of calves with diarrhoea [relative risk (RR) 7·6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1·7-33·5] and eating in clinic cars (RR 9·1, 95% CI 1·3-65·8) were associated with being a case. Washing hands at least twice per farm visit (0 cases, P = 0·03) was protective. This outbreak investigation was notable for rapid and effective collaboration between public health, veterinary and environmental sectors, leading to swift identification of a microbiological and epidemiological link between cases, infected calves and their farms. We recommend frequent hand-washing using proper technique and dissuasion from eating in clinic cars to minimize possible exposure to contaminated surfaces. "

This method limits the evaluation and imposes an obstacle for quantitative analysis of several parameters. The development of tissue culture techniques to evaluate the bioactivity of potential organic compounds alleviated these problems and provided a reliable prediction regarding the biocompatibility of biomaterials when compared with parallel animal testing. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of various biomedical polymers on the adhesion rate of transformed HeLa cells as a model. The HeLa cells used in this study seeded by following our standard laboratory procedure. A total of 1.5 x 10(5) cells were plated in each of the pretreated wells with various concentrations of (0.01 0.1 and 1% wt/vol) polyvaline (P-Val), polyalanine (P-Ala), polytryptophan (P-Trp), polyasparagine (P-Asn), polyaspartate (P-Asp), poly glycine (P-Gly), and buffered control. At the end of 1,4, and 24 hours the cell viability was determined by hexoamindase activity. The data obtained from this study suggest that (I) the ease of adhesion of HeLa cells were in the following order: P-Val = P-Ala > P-Gly = P-Trp = P-Asp = P-Asn > Control, (II) the rate of HeLa cells spreading was strongly influenced by both incubation time and the polymer concentration, and (III) the surface attachment of HeLa to the polymer were demonstrated to vary depending on their chemical structure and level of microporosity. Thus, overall observation led us to conclude that the surface reactivity of polymer materials be always taken into account in discussing their biocompatibility in vivo."

After resuming mitotic activity, gonocytes relocate on the basement membrane, giving rise to spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). These processes begin from birth in mice, and differentiated type A spermatogonia first appear by day 6 postpartum. During these processes, Sertoli cells within the seminiferous tubules and Leydig cells in the interstitial tissue form the stem cell ""niche,"" and influence SSC fate decisions. Thus, we collected whole mouse testis tissues during the first wave of spermatogenesis at specific time points (days 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, and 5.5 postpartum) and constructed a comparative proteomic profile. We identified 252 differentially expressed proteins classified into three clusters based on expression, and bioinformatics analysis correlated each protein pattern to specific cell processes. Expression patterns of nine selected proteins were verified via Western blot, and cellular localizations of three proteins with little known information in testes were further investigated during spermatogenesis. Taken together, the results provide an important reference profile of a functional proteome during neonatal mouse gonocyte and SSC maturation and differentiation. "

This will vary according to the target condition and setting, but generally surgery versus non-invasive imaging will be considered (seeTable 3) Aspects of study conduct, specifically: blinding and reporting of uninterpretable or intermediate results.",24325203,0,Usefulness of proton and phosphorus MR spectroscopic imaging for early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.,"Cerebral mitochondrial dysfunction has been observed in Parkinson's disease (PD). If mitochondrial dysfunction is an early event contributing to PD development, then noninvasive techniques that detect disturbed energy metabolism in vivo might be useful tools for early diagnosis and treatment monitoring. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that proton ((1) H) and phosphorus ((31) P) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) measures of brain metabolites are able to differentiate between individuals with early PD and healthy volunteers (HVs)."

It is characterized by seizures, alteration of consciousness, visual disturbances, and symmetric white matter abnormalities, typically in the posterior parietooccipital regions of the cerebral hemispheres, at computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MRI). We report three new cases of PRES in preeclamptic patients and describe the management of these patients. We present a brief review of other cases in the literature, with particular attention to the anesthetic management. "

B6.GT mice develop severe polyclonal lymphoproliferative disease because of accumulating CD3(+)CD4(-)CD8(-)B220(+) T cells, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, and follicular B cells, and mice die prematurely from extreme lymphocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and hemorrhage. Accumulating lymphocytes resembled antigen-experienced lymphocytes, consistent with the maximal resistance of B6.GT CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell to activation-induced cell death. More specifically, we show that TRAIL contributes to Fas ligand-mediated activation-induced cell death and controls lymphocyte apoptosis in the presence of interferon-gamma once antigen stimulation is removed. Furthermore, dysregulated lymphocyte homeostasis results in the production of anti-DNA and rheumatoid factor autoantibodies, as well as antiplatelet IgM and IgG causing thrombocytopenia. Thus, B6.GT mice reveal new roles for TRAIL in lymphocyte homeostasis and autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndromes and are a model of spontaneous idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura secondary to lymphoproliferative disease."

The islands of Oceania offer an excellent setting to explore this contrast, because the geographic setting for terrestrial and shallow-water, benthic, marine organisms are the same: the myriad islands strewn across the vast Pacific. The size of species ranges and the geographic distribution of endemism are two biogeographic attributes that are thought to differ markedly between terrestrial and marine biotas in the Pacific. While terrestrial species are frequently confined to single islands or archipelagoes throughout Oceania, marine species tend to have wide to very wide distributions, and are rarely restricted to single island groups except for the most isolated archipelagoes. We explore the conditions under which species can reach an island by dispersal and differentiate. Genetic differentiation can occur either through founder speciation or vicariance; these processes are requisite ends of a continuum. We show that founder speciation is most likely when few propagules enter the dispersal medium and survive well while they travel far. We argue that conditions favorable to founder speciation are common in marine as well as terrestrial systems, and that terrestrial-type, archipelagic-level endemism is likely common in marine taxa. We give examples of marine groups that show archipelagic level endemism on most Pacific island groups as well as of terrestrial species that are widespread. Thus both the patterns and processes of insular diversification are variable, and overlap more between land and sea than previously considered."

When the receptor is in the nonconducting desensitized state, the alpha-gamma site binds the agonist epibatidine 200-fold more tightly than does the alpha-delta site. To determine the structural basis for this selectivity, we constructed gamma/delta-subunit chimeras, coexpressed them with complementary wild-type subunits in HEK 293 cells, and determined epibatidine affinity of the resulting complexes. The results reveal three determinants of epibatidine selectivity: gamma104-117/delta106-delta119, gamma164-171/delta166-177, and gammaPro190/deltaAla196. Point mutations reveal that three sequence differences within the gamma104-117/delta106-delta119 region are determinants of epibatidine selectivity: gammaLys104/deltaTyr106, gammaSer111/deltaTyr113, and gammaTyr117/deltaTyr119. In the delta-subunit, simultaneous mutation of these residues to their gamma equivalent produces high affinity, gamma-like epibatidine binding. However, converting gamma to delta affinity requires replacement of the gamma104-117 segment with delta sequence, suggesting interplay of residues in this region. The structural basis for epibatidine selectivity is explained by computational docking of epibatidine to a homology model of the alpha-gamma binding site."

The exact aetiology of the injury is not yet fully understood. The major constituent of tendons is type 1 collagen which is encoded by COL1A1 gene. The aim of the study was to determine whether Sp1 binding site polymorphism (SNP rs1800012; 1546G/T) within the intronic region of COL1A1 gene is associated with tennis elbow. One hundred and three tennis elbow patients and one hundred and three healthy subjects without any history of previous ligament or tendon injuries were recruited for this genetic association study. All participants were genotyped for the COL1A1 Sp1 binding site polymorphism by using PCR-RFLP method. There were no observed statistical differences in the genotype (p=0.17) or allele (p=0.11) distributions between the groups. G allele frequency in patients and controls was 82.5% and 76.21%, and T allele frequency was 17.5% and 23.79% respectively. This study has shown that there is no association between this polymorphism and tennis elbow within the population studied."

The 14 diverticula, 5--28 mm long, were either along the diaphragmatic or anterior ventricular wall. Only one patient had his diverticulum surgically removed; the wall was lined by thick endocardium surrounded by normal myocardium. The lesions did not produce local or systemic complications. All patients had normal chest radiographs. The material suggests that left ventricular diverticula not associated with midline anomalies are perhaps not very rare and should be distinguished from cardiac aneurysm."

Oxalacetate (OAA) reversed lipoate-inhibited QO2 and QH+ of chambered mucosas by 70 and 40%, respectively. Pyruvate or glucose produced similar effects. Neither activity was affected by OAA when added after glucose, pyruvate, decanoate, butyrate, or lipoate-propionate-inhibited mucosa. Lipoate-treated or lipoate-propionate-treated mucosa did not respond to histamine; OAA addition prior to histamine restored responsiveness. Tracer and chromatographic techniques showed that lipoate reduced and pyruvate increased OAA formation. Preincubation of mitochondrial extracts of gastric mucosa with 2 mM lipoate increased pyruvic dehydrogenase activity 110%. Pyruvic carboxylase (PC) activity was primarily in the mitochondrial fraction of the gastric mucosa. The PC preparation was shown to have an absolute requirement for CoASAc, contained biotin, was not inhibited by lipoate, and had an apparent Km approximately equal to 3.6 X 10(-4) M for pyruvate. The results suggest that OAA concentration is regulated by PC activity and is one of the factors controlling QO2 and QH+ in the frog gastric mucosa."

RAG-1 produced an extracellular nondialyzable emulsifying agent when grown on hexadecane, ethanol, or acetate medium. The emulsifier was prepared by two procedures: (i) heptane extraction of the cell-free culture medium and (ii) precipitation with ammonium sulfate. A convenient assay was developed for measurement of emulsifier concentrations between 3 and 75 micrograms/ml. The rate of emulsion fromation was proportional to both hydrocarbon and emulsifier concentrations. Above pH 6, activity was dependent upon divalent cations; half-maximum activity was obtained in the presence of 1.5 mM Mg2+. With a ratio of gas oil to emulsifier of 50, stable emulsions were formed with average droplet sizes of less than 1 micron. Emulsifier production was parallel to growth on either hydrocarbon or nonhydrocarbon substrates during the exponential phase; however, production continued after growth ceased."

The fibrin dressing has existed for decades, but the military has been reluctant to use the dressing because it is not Food and Drug Administration approved, fairly expensive, and difficult to apply on certain wounds. Newer dressings such as the microporous polysaccharide hemosphere (TraumaDEX), mineral zeolite (QuikClot), poly-N-acetylglucosamine (HemCon), and microporous hydrogel-forming polyacrylamide (BioHemostat) dressings have addressed these deficiencies in that they are relatively inexpensive, easy to transport, and easy to apply. However, the effectiveness of these new dressings on wounds sustained in combat is still questionable according to studies and anecdotal reports from Operation Iraqi Freedom. More research is needed to draw definite conclusions about the effectiveness of these dressings in a combat setting."

In consequence, caffeine, when acting as an AR antagonist, is doing the opposite of activation of adenosine receptors due to removal of endogenous adenosinergic tonus. Besides AR antagonism, xanthines, including caffeine, have other biological actions: they inhibit phosphodiesterases (PDEs) (e.g., PDE1, PDE4, PDE5), promote calcium release from intracellular stores, and interfere with GABA-A receptors. Caffeine, through antagonism of ARs, affects brain functions such as sleep, cognition, learning, and memory, and modifies brain dysfunctions and diseases: Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Epilepsy, Pain/Migraine, Depression, Schizophrenia. In conclusion, targeting approaches that involve ARs will enhance the possibilities to correct brain dysfunctions, via the universally consumed substance that is caffeine."

The two techniques showed similar results in 64% of the cases of cell contamination while the remainder was detected only by one or the other techniques: 12,82% by the staining technique and 23% by the isolation technique, which shows that the 2 techniques are complementary. The staining technique is very quick, easy to execute, very sensitive, and should be the method of choice to detect contamination when the mycoplasma do not grow in acellular media."

Salicornia europaea, a stem succulent halophyte with remarkable salt resistance and high capacity for ion accumulation, has not been investigated with regards to the selection of appropriate reference genes for RT-qPCR. In this study, the expression of 11 candidate reference genes, GAPDH (Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase), Actin, α-Tub (α-tubulin), β-Tub (β-tubulin), EF1-α (Elongation factor 1-α), UBC (Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme), UBQ (Polyubiquitin), CYP (Cyclophilin), TIP41 (TIP41-like protein), CAC (Clathrin adaptor complexes), and DNAJ (DnaJ-like protein), was analyzed in S. europaea samples, which were classified into groups according to various abiotic stresses (NaCl, nitrogen, drought, cold and heat), tissues and ages. Three commonly used software programs (geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper) were applied to evaluate the stability of gene expression, and comprehensive ranks of stability were generated by aggregate analysis. The results show that the relatively stable genes for each group are the following: (1) CAC and UBC for whole samples; (2) CAC and UBC for NaCl stress; (3) Actin and α-Tub for nitrogen treatment; (4) Actin and GAPDH for drought stress; (5) α-Tub and UBC for cold stress; (6) TIP41 and DNAJ for heat stress; (7) UBC and UBQ for different tissues; and (8) UBC and Actin for various developmental stages. These genes were validated by comparing transcriptome profiles. Using two stable reference genes was recommended in the normalization of RT-qPCR data. This study identifies optimal reference genes for RT-qPCR in S. europaea, which will benefit gene expression analysis under these conditions. "

All of the hybridomas were of the H-2d haplotype and could potentially accept antigen in the context of either the Ad or Ed, H-2 molecules. Three types of antigen presentation were observed, with some of the T cell hybridomas accepting antigen in the context of the E and some in the context of the A molecule. A third type of hybridoma responded to antigen presented by paraformaldehyde fixed APC, but only when APCs were E positive. These same hybridomas, were however, stimulated by AWH, when the antigen was presented by syngeneic but unfixed, E positive or E negative APC. Therefore these data indicate that certain H. polygyrus-specific T cell hybridomas can accept parasite antigen when presented in the context of either the H-2 A or E molecule, but the presentation of antigen by the two different MHC Class II molecules, can apparently utilize differing processing mechanisms."

Prognostic factors allow to classify patients into homogeneic risk groups, to adapt treatment proposal to disease's risk and, in some cases, to avoid over-treatment. For all lymphomas, the first step is to determine the stage of the disease in Ann Arbor's classification, using physical examination, radiological and functional imaging. However, this classification is not optimal to predict disease evolution. Specific scores corresponding to the histological subtype of the lymphoma have been determined: IPI (international prognostic index) for aggressive lymphomas, FLIPI (follicular lymphoma international prognostic index) for indolent lymphomas and IPS (international prognostic score) for advanced Hodgkin's lymphomas. Functional imaging by PET (position emission tomography) is of prognostic significance in aggressive and Hodgkin lymphomas to evaluate early response to treatment, before autografting and at the end of the treatment. Several kinds of molecular prognostic markers have been studied: circulating rates of proteins, over expression of genes, presence of specific cells in the tumour... But these factors are not yet used in clinical practice, as they have not been validated on large cohorts and their interactions with other prognostic factors and between them are not well known. Although molecular biology has made some recent progress, only classical prognostic factors (physical examination, radiological and functional imaging) are used by now."

Injections of Abeta into the retrosplenial cortex resulted in a decrease in alpha7nAChR-immunoreactivity in the hippocampus. Quantitative analysis revealed a significant reduction in alpha7nAChR-immunoreactivity in the dorsal part of the CA1 ipsilateral to the Abeta-injected side as compared to the corresponding hemisphere of non-treated control animals and with that seen in the contralateral hemisphere, which corresponds to the control (PBS)-injected side. A significant decrease in alpha7nAChR-immunoreactivity was also found in the dorsal part of the ipsilateral CA1 as compared with that in the ventral part of the CA1, in CA2, and in CA3 ipsilateral to the Abeta-injected side. The analysis also revealed a significant decrease in alpha7nAChR-immunoreactivity in the dentate gyrus ipsilateral to the Abeta-injected side as compared to the corresponding hemisphere of non-treated control animals and with that in the PBS-injected side co-localization studies showed that the alpha7nAChR protein is highly localized in GABA- and Parv-immunoreactive cells, while only few Calb-positive cells expressed immunoreactivity for alpha7nAChR. In addition, injections of Abeta protein resulted in a significant reduction in the number of GABA- and Parv-immunoreactive cells in the dorsal part of the ipsilateral CA1 as compared to the corresponding region of non-treated control animals and with that in the corresponding region of the PBS-injected side. Our findings suggest that Abeta induces a reduction in alpha7nAChR-containing cells, which may contribute to impairment of GABAergic synaptic transmission in the hippocampus."

Clobazam was half as potent as diazepam in depressing the amplitude of visual evoked potentials in the nonanaesthetized rabbit, whereas the depressing effect on spinal polysynaptic reflexes in the decerebrated cat was only 1/7 --1/30 of the diazepam effect. The action of clobazam and diazepam on VEP also showed differences in time course, i.e., the peak effect of clobazam lasted from 1 to 6 h after application, whereas the effect of diazepam appeared after 10 min and declined already after 1 h. Both compounds had similar effects on computer-analyzed spontaneous EEG in the rabbit (power spectrum analysis), with an increase of power in the beta-band (13-39Hz) and a decrease in the alpha (8-13 Hz) and theta (4-8Hz) bands."

From the principle of causality and the Kramers-Kronig relations, we show that both quantities are connected by dispersion relations and are constrained by a frequency sum rule. The results should be helpful in the analysis of wave transport through complex media and in the design of materials with specific transport properties."

Effects of adrenergic therapy.,"Blood specimens for measurement of leukocyte cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) were obtained at weekly intervals from asthmatic children who were participating in a double-blind, crossover study to compare the effects of two adrenergic agents and a placebo. When patients were treated with the placebo, the basal measurements and the cyclic AMP responses of leukocytes to in vitro stimulation with epinephrine (10(-4) M) were similar to those of normal subjects but within one week after initiation of treatment with an adrenergic bronchodilator, leukocyte cyclic AMP responses to adrenergic stimulation in vitro decreased and remained low during the remainder of the treatment period. Within one week after discontinuation of adrenergic therapy, leukocyte cyclic AMP responses returned to the control level. Our results indicate that the alterations in leukocyte cyclic AMP metabolism which have been observed previously in asthmatic patients may result from medications used for treatment of asthma."

There is a general consensus that the most effective way to prevent new infections is to introduce a prophylactic vaccine. It is also generally agreed that both cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and neutralising antibodies are important to mediate protection. The neutralising antibodies must be broadly reactive to neutralise multiple primary isolates. There is also increasing agreement that CTLs and neutralising antibodies should be present at mucosal sites of HIV entry, the draining lymph nodes and systemically. The route of immunisation is important when determining the site where protection is desired, i.e. the female genitourinary tract versus the male or female rectum versus systemic tissues, as are the type of HIV-related antigens, immunopotentiating adjuvants and delivery systems. Finally, multiple vaccine delivery systems may be required to be administered through both mucosal and parenteral routes to induce optimal immune responses and protection against HIV infection through rectal, vaginal or systemic routes of transmission. This review discusses current efforts on the generation of optimal immune responses against HIV in the genitourinary and intestinal tracts using mucosal immunisations alone or combinations of mucosal and parenteral immunisations."

We also examined the physical tests according to whether they were intended to: identify impingement in general (or differentiate it from other causes of shoulder pain, e.g. 'frozen shoulder') subcategorise impingement as subacromial outlet impingement (impingement under the acromion process) or internal impingement (impingement within the shoulder joint) diagnose lesions of bursa, tendon or glenoid labrum that may be associated with impingement form part of a diagnostic package or process and, if so, according to the stages at which they may apply. Investigation of sources of heterogeneity We planned to investigate the following potential sources of heterogeneity. Study population: older general population; young athletic population; other well defined groups e.g. wheelchair users or swimmers (see the Differences between protocol and review) Stage of clinical care: primary (generally in the community setting), secondary (referral following preliminary screening) or tertiary (referral to a specialist centre) Study design: cross sectional (or cohort) versus case-control; retrospective versus prospective design Type of reference test.

This strain presented high absorption in the UVA region, in particular in the near UVA region around 370nm, followed by the far-UVA region around 340nm. Absorption in the near-UVA increased when grown under fluorescent when compared to halogen light. This was even more relevant when grown under nutrient-limiting conditions, which even surpassed absorption in the blue region, closely resembling absorption in natural plankton assemblages reported in the literature. HPLC analysis for mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), revealed several UV photoprotective pigments common in other marine microalgae from the northwest Atlantic. Amongst the compounds absorbing in the far-UVA region, three were identified by spectra and retention time characteristics: shinorine, porphyra-334, and mycosporine-glycine. In the near-UVA region, the unknown M-370 was usually the most abundant, followed by palythene. The proportional and absolute cellular concentrations of MAAs absorbing in the near-UVA region increased with fluorescent light when compared to halogen light. Additional experiments with light filtration suggest the set of MAAs absorbing in the near-UVA region seem to be regulated separately from the other set of MAAs absorbing in the far-UVA region, and those from the near-UVA region might be stimulated not only by UV but by blue light also. Nutrient availability affected profile: a shift towards MAAs with low nitrogen:carbon ratio (e.g.: mycosporine-glycine) was observed. As G. catenatum requires extensive UV-photoprotection over the entire UVA range, nitrogen availability might strongly restrict blooming, as MAAs are nitrogen-based. This UV sensitivity might help explaining its pronounced autumnal seasonality, tied to a reduced solar exposure. "

Cytoplasmic granules measuring about 0.3-0.4 μm and all the cellular organelles associated with protein and carbohydrate synthesis can be seen in both dark and light chief cells; the cytoplasm of oxyphils is packed with mitochondria which obscure other organelles. An unusual feature of the dark chief cells is the presence of crystalline-like material within parallel arrays of cisternae of rough endoplasmic reticulum. A similar crystalline-like structure is seen occasionally within some cytoplasmic granules.

Cyanobacteria are the photosynthetic prokaryotes having bioremedial capacity. We have isolated a cyanobacterium from the sewage recycling fish-pond of East Kolkata Wetlands. Partial sequence of 16S rDNA gene of the isolated strain showed 100% similarity with that of genus Synechocystis. Isolated strain and Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 survived up to 300 mug ml(-1) Pb(2+ )and growth was completely inhibited at 400 mug ml(-1) Pb(2+). All experiments were carried out with 100 mug ml(-1) Pb(2+) in which growth was the maximum. 91.67% of the total Pb(2+) got adsorbed to the outer surface of the cell and 1% of the total Pb(2+) entered the cell of the isolated strain as estimated by atomic absorption spectrometry, but in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 72.72% adsorbed and 0.96% penetrated. Intracellular and periplasmic depositions of Pb(2+) were observed in both the strain. A filamentous structure developed outside the cell wall of the isolated cyanobacterium, but very little change was observed in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. ZiaR-SmtB like regulator gene was expressed in both the strains after Pb(2+) induction. The cDNA sequence of ZiaR of the isolated cyanobacterium shows 100% homology with that of Synechocystis sp.

In the memory-access condition, a digit from WM had to be used as the first number in the equation; in the no-access condition, complete equations were presented so that no information from WM had to be accessed for the computation. Updating a digit not updated in the preceding step took longer than updating the same digit as in the preceding step, a time difference referred to as object-switch costs. Object-switch costs were equal in access and no-access equations, implying that they did not reflect the time to retrieve a new digit from WM. Access equations were completed as fast as no-access equations, implying that access to information in WM is as fast as reading the same information. No-access equations were slowed by a mismatch between the first digit of the presented equation and the to-be-updated digit in WM, showing that this digit is automatically accessed even when not needed. It is concluded that contents and their contexts form composites in WM that are necessarily accessed together."

The CSF-protein patterns found on isoelectric focusing and quantitative paper electrophoresis were studied in 12 patients with hereditary ataxias and hereditary spastic paraplegia. Using a recently-developed technique of isoelectric focusing of CSF-proteins in flat beds of polyacrylamide gel, the authors could show abnormal CSF-protein patterns in all but 1 of the present cases. The aberrant CSF-protein patterns found showed differences between the syndromes studied. Two unique patterns with conspicuous fractions in the acid range were observed in patients with Marie-Sanger-Brown's ataxia (mother and daughter) and Holmes' ataxia. A third CSF-protein pattern was found in a sibship with Friedreich's ataxia including a double fraction in the acid region (pI 5.9-6.1) in all 4 subjects and a highly alkaline fraction (HAF) with pI about 9.3, in 3 of them. Similar acid fractions (pI 5.9-6.1) were also detected in 3 of 4 patients with hereditary spastic paraplegia, a brother and sister showing a very similar CSF-protein pattern. Double fractions with pI 5.9-6.1 and/or HAF may also occur in other neurological diseases, mostly, however, associated with other distinctive features of their CSF-protein patterns. A possibility in the future of distinguishing hereditary CNS-diseases by examination of the CSF-protein pattern is suggested."

We found that although many CD8(+) T cells transcribe CD94 and NKG2C, expression of a functional CD94:NKG2C receptor is restricted to highly differentiated effector cells. CD94:NKG2A is expressed by a different subset consisting of CCR7(+) memory cells and CCR7(-) effector cells. Since NKG2A can only be induced on naive CD8(+) T cells while CD94(-) memory cells are refractory, it is likely that commitment to the CD94:NKG2A(+) subset occurs during the first encounter with antigen. CCR7(+)CD94:NKG2A(+) T cells recirculate through lymph nodes where upon activation, they produce large quantities of IFN-gamma. These cells occur as a separate CD94:NKG2A(+) T cell lineage with a distinct TCR repertoire that differs from that of the other CD8(+)CD94(-) T cells activated in situ."

Medicinal plants provide an enormous bioresource of potential use in modern medicine and agriculture, yet their microbiome is largely unknown. The objective of this review is (i) to introduce novel insights into the plant microbiome with a focus on medicinal plants, (ii) to provide details about plant- and microbe-derived ingredients of medicinal plants, and (iii) to discuss possibilities for plant growth promotion and plant protection for commercial cultivation of medicinal plants. In addition, we also present a case study performed both to analyse the microbiome of three medicinal plants (Matricaria chamomilla L., Calendula officinalis L., and Solanum distichum Schumach. and Thonn.) cultivated on organically managed Egyptian desert farm and to develop biological control strategies. The soil microbiome of the desert ecosystem was comprised of a high abundance of Gram-positive bacteria of prime importance for pathogen suppression under arid soil conditions. For all three plants, we observed a clearly plant-specific selection of the microbes as well as highly specific diazotrophic communities that overall identify plant species as important drivers in structural and functional diversity. Lastly, native Bacillus spec. div. strains were able to promote plant growth and elevate the plants' flavonoid production. These results underline the numerous links between the plant-associated microbiome and the plant metabolome. "
